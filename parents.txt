when  
I  
found  
out  
that  
my  
daughter  
had  
leukemia  
I  
I  
mean  
you  
as  
a  
as  
you  
know  
I  
think  
that  
people  
in  
general  
don't  
pay  
attention  
to  
childhood  
cancer  
just  
because  
if  
it's  
not  
in  
front  
of  
you  
if  
it's  
not  
affecting  
you  
Gipp  
directly  
then  
it's  
it's  
hard  
to  
look  
at  
it  
and  
so  
you  
don't  
think  
about  
it  
and  
then  
all  
of  
a  
sudden  
it's  
your  
kid  
and  
it's  
fast  
as  
soon  
as  
you  
find  
out  
within  
a  
couple  
days  
they've  
got  
a  
port  
which  
you  
don't  
know  
what  
that  
is  
yeah  
they're  
like  
we're  
gonna  
just  
implant  
this  
thing  
into  
your  
daughter's  
underneath  
her  
skin  
on  
her  
chest  
and  
it's  
gonna  
just  
stay  
there  
for  
the  
next  
two  
and  
a  
half  
years  
and  
the  
treatment  
for  
for  
a  
ll  
leukemia  
that  
which  
is  
what  
my  
daughter  
has  
she's  
five  
it  
is  
two  
and  
a  
half  
years  
long  
and  
that's  
if  
she  
doesn't  
relapse  
so  
hopefully  
she's  
not  
going  
to  
be  
relapsing  
but  
that  
is  
one  
thing  
that  
is  
constantly  
on  
every  
parent's  
mind  
that  
has  
a  
child  
with  
especially  
I  
think  
cancer  
or  
diseases  
that  
can  
reoccur  
it's  
constantly  
on  
your  
mind  
of  
oh  
my  
gosh  
is  
it  
gonna  
come  
back  
is  
it  
gonna  
come  
back  
is  
it  
gonna  
come  
back  
and  
is  
it  
gonna  
is  
my  
child  
gonna  
die  
because  
of  
this  
and  
when  
I  
heard  
that  
she  
had  
leukemia  
because  
I  
didn't  
know  
anything  
about  
childhood  
cancer  
I  
thought  
she  
I  
thought  
they  
were  
telling  
me  
that  
my  
daughter  
was  
gonna  
die  
so  
I  
collapsed  
on  
to  
the  
hospital  
Flor  
in  
a  
mess  
of  
tears  
and  
was  
just  
screaming  
no  
and  
just  
like  
and  
I  
can  
there's  
even  
parts  
of  
that  
time  
period  
that  
night  
when  
I  
found  
out  
that  
I  
don't  
even  
remember  
because  
it  
was  
just  
so  
traumatic  
and  
then  
having  
to  
hold  
my  
daughter  
down  
while  
they're  
trying  
to  
get  
an  
IV  
and  
they  
can't  
get  
it  
because  
she's  
you  
know  
got  
some  
really  
small  
veins  
and  
she's  
tiny  
and  
so  
they're  
poking  
her  
over  
and  
over  
and  
over  
and  
over  
again  
and  
she's  
sobbing  
and  
begging  
me  
to  
have  
them  
stop  
and  
I  
can't  
do  
anything  
about  
it  
I  
can't  
do  
anything  
I  
have  
to  
let  
them  
do  
it  
because  
that's  
the  
only  
way  
that  
she's  
gonna  
live  
and  
it  
is  
the  
most  
heart  
wrenching  
thing  
that  
you  
will  
ever  
go  
through  
as  
a  
parent  
there  
is  
nothing  
more  
heartbreaking  
than  
watching  
your  
child  
suffer  
and  
knowing  
that  
you  
have  
to  
let  
the  
suffering  
HAP  
happen  
in  
order  
for  
them  
to  
come  
through  
the  
other  
side  
and  
you  
can  
it  
can  
it  
threw  
you  
off  
I'd  
be  
like  
what  
but  
as  
far  
as  
like  
day-to-day  
life  
goes  
after  
you  
find  
out  
like  
you're  
always  
in  
the  
hospital  
at  
appointments  
at  
the  
clinic  
you  
and  
you  
don't  
they  
you  
don't  
make  
your  
own  
appointments  
they  
make  
you  
the  
appointments  
for  
you  
so  
they  
tell  
you  
when  
you  
have  
to  
be  
there  
so  
your  
schedule  
is  
built  
around  
what  
they  
tell  
you  
and  
so  
you  
know  
a  
lot  
of  
people  
can't  
work  
because  
of  
you  
know  
the  
fact  
that  
there  
you  
know  
they  
hate  
hey  
you  
have  
to  
take  
your  
kid  
for  
this  
test  
and  
this  
to  
have  
this  
done  
and  
this  
and  
you  
have  
to  
come  
on  
this  
day  
and  
it  
has  
to  
be  
at  
this  
time  
and  
that's  
the  
only  
option  
and  
so  
you  
know  
you  
and  
when  
you're  
a  
parent  
you  
do  
whatever  
you  
have  
to  
do  
to  
make  
sure  
that  
your  
child  
is  
okay  
and  
so  
if  
you  
have  
to  
quit  
your  
job  
and  
you  
have  
to  
you  
know  
eat  
ramen  
like  
you  
weren't  
in  
college  
and  
do  
whatever  
you  
do  
it  
and  
but  
the  
day  
to  
day  
life  
is  
it's  
hard  
because  
your  
kids  
are  
suffering  
and  
you  
see  
other  
children  
that  
are  
out  
and  
they're  
your  
your  
kids  
friends  
and  
they're  
out  
there  
and  
their  
lives  
are  
going  
on  
and  
they're  
continuing  
to  
do  
the  
things  
that  
they  
do  
on  
a  
day  
to  
day  
basis  
like  
going  
to  
dance  
class  
going  
to  
preschool  
going  
to  
you  
know  
birthday  
parties  
and  
my  
daughter  
can't  
do  
any  
of  
that  
stuff  
because  
of  
her  
counts  
and  
so  
she  
basically  
has  
we've  
stayed  
in  
the  
house  
for  
the  
last  
year  
and  
so  
she  
is  
you  
know  
I  
mean  
I've  
got  
her  
doing  
a  
lot  
of  
art  
projects  
and  
I  
got  
her  
doing  
music  
and  
stuff  
but  
it's  
really  
rough  
because  
it's  
constantly  
in  
your  
face  
and  
because  
of  
the  
fact  
that  
there's  
the  
physical  
changes  
the  
steroids  
that  
they  
put  
them  
on  
that's  
why  
the  
kids  
have  
the  
huge  
cheeks  
and  
the  
big  
bellies  
the  
physical  
changes  
and  
the  
hair  
loss  
and  
then  
there's  
also  
medications  
that  
they  
put  
them  
on  
that  
makes  
hair  
grow  
on  
in  
weird  
spaces  
and  
those  
physical  
changes  
in  
your  
child  
are  
so  
heartbreaking  
there  
is  
I  
mean  
and  
it's  
in  
your  
face  
all  
the  
time  
because  
you  
still  
you  
have  
to  
take  
care  
of  
your  
child's  
and  
you  
have  
to  
look  
at  
them  
and  
you  
know  
that  
they're  
so  
sick  
and  
every  
time  
you  
look  
at  
them  
it's  
right  
there  
and  
so  
I  
mean  
for  
the  
first  
six  
or  
seven  
months  
blue  
cried  
like  
ten  
times  
a  
day  
just  
like  
I  
would  
have  
to  
just  
dismiss  
myself  
and  
go  
into  
the  
bathroom  
and  
just  
because  
some  
you  
know  
something  
would  
happen  
and  
it  
would  
trigger  
like  
a  
memory  
of  
like  
oh  
when  
I  
was  
holding  
her  
down  
and  
she's  
crying  
like  
when  
I  
was  
holding  
her  
down  
right  
now  
and  
it's  
bringing  
that  
back  
into  
my  
and  
it's  
just  
a  
lot  
of  
parents  
experience  
that  
kind  
of  
thing  
and  
nightmares  
not  
being  
able  
to  
sleep  
nighttime  
is  
a  
really  
hard  
time  
because  
you  
don't  
have  
your  
kids  
are  
sleep  
so  
you  
don't  
have  
to  
take  
care  
of  
them  
and  
so  
your  
mind  
starts  
going  
and  
then  
you  
start  
thinking  
oh  
I  
saw  
a  
bruise  
on  
her  
is  
that  
a  
sign  
of  
it  
coming  
back  
oh  
my  
gosh  
she  
felt  
a  
little  
bit  
nauseous  
you  
know  
more  
nauseous  
this  
week  
like  
is  
the  
medication  
starting  
to  
have  
like  
more  
side  
effects  
on  
her  
is  
she's  
starting  
to  
you  
know  
is  
she  
gonna  
start  
to  
you  
know  
have  
some  
of  
the  
symptoms  
that  
I'm  
seeing  
some  
of  
my  
friends  
kids  
have  
that  
are  
heartbreaking  
like  
you  
know  
just  
having  
liver  
problems  
kidney  
problems  
heart  
problems  
if  
it  
goes  
into  
their  
own  
earth  
it  
goes  
into  
their  
spinal  
fluid  
there's  
just  
so  
many  
different  
secondary  
conditions  
too  
that  
can  
be  
caused  
just  
I  
mean  
even  
by  
the  
treatment  
that  
they're  
on  
and  
so  
I  
mean  
you're  
you're  
in  
the  
hospital  
with  
your  
child  
and  
they're  
giving  
them  
this  
chemo  
and  
you  
know  
that  
and  
it  
says  
on  
the  
bag  
hazardous  
there  
are  
people  
that  
come  
in  
to  
give  
it  
to  
your  
child  
or  
in  
like  
a  
bubble  
suit  
and  
they  
come  
in  
and  
they've  
got  
the  
syringe  
and  
you  
know  
nobody  
can  
touch  
the  
the  
medicine  
because  
it  
will  
burn  
your  
skin  
and  
so  
they're  
they're  
injecting  
this  
into  
my  
daughter  
and  
I'm  
just  
going  
I  
wanted  
to  
go  
over  
there  
and  
just  
smack  
the  
syringe  
out  
of  
the  
woman's  
hand  
but  
I  
was  
like  
I  
have  
no  
other  
options  
I  
mean  
this  
is  
what  
this  
is  
what  
there  
is  
and  
so  
it's  
it's  
heartbreaking  
chemo  
is  
is  
horrible  
and  
the  
bone  
marrow  
transplant  
kids  
that's  
even  
worse  
it's  
heartbreaking  
and  
then  
you  
go  
into  
the  
hospital  
and  
you're  
faced  
with  
the  
exact  
same  
thing  
you  
see  
all  
these  
other  
kids  
that  
are  
suffering  
so  
even  
if  
your  
child  
is  
having  
a  
good  
day  
you  
can  
walk  
into  
the  
clinic  
and  
see  
three  
kids  
that  
are  
like  
having  
a  
horrible  
day  
and  
then  
that  
brings  
your  
mindset  
back  
down  
to  
the  
oh  
my  
god  
like  
Oh  
is  
my  
daughter  
gonna  
be  
back  
in  
that  
spot  
is  
she  
gonna  
make  
it  
through  
this  
is  
she's  
gonna  
make  
it  
to  
you  
know  
the  
end  
of  
the  
two  
years  
without  
having  
a  
relapse  
is  
she  
gonna  
is  
she  
gonna  
relapse  
if  
she  
relapses  
is  
she  
gonna  
die  
and  
I  
mean  
you  
know  
you  
think  
about  
like  
things  
like  
your  
child's  
funeral  
and  
you  
would  
never  
think  
about  
your  
child's  
funeral  
if  
you  
know  
you  
weren't  
in  
this  
situation  
but  
and  
even  
though  
my  
daughter  
has  
a  
good  
chance  
of  
survival  
you  
still  
mean  
you  
know  
that  
it's  
a  
terminal  
illness  
and  
so  
in  
the  
back  
of  
your  
mind  
you're  
like  
almost  
it's  
almost  
like  
you're  
kind  
of  
trying  
to  
mentally  
prepare  
yourself  
just  
in  
case  
because  
it  
you  
know  
that  
it's  
gonna  
be  
like  
the  
most  
heart  
wrenching  
like  
soul-crushing  
thing  
that  
could  
ever  
happen  
to  
you  
and  
so  
it's  
almost  
like  
your  
your  
mind  
is  
like  
trying  
to  
prepare  
yourself  
for  
it  
and  
it's  
that's  
just  
a  
whole  
other  
thing  
too  
it's  
it's  
a  
horrible  
perfect  
yeah  
perfect  
example  
I  
actually  
have  
a  
friend  
who  
is  
she  
has  
a  
son  
that  
has  
is  
the  
same  
age  
as  
my  
daughter  
has  
same  
illness  
but  
he  
had  
to  
go  
straight  
to  
transplant  
she  
actually  
got  
sick  
and  
she's  
pregnant  
and  
her  
husband's  
a  
truck  
driver  
so  
he  
couldn't  
go  
stay  
with  
her  
her  
son  
and  
she  
couldn't  
stay  
with  
him  
because  
she  
was  
sick  
so  
there  
was  
nobody  
to  
stay  
with  
this  
five-year-old  
boy  
overnight  
in  
the  
hospital  
so  
that's  
a  
perfect  
example  
right  
there  
that  
if  
some  
if  
there  
was  
somebody  
that  
could  
have  
come  
and  
spent  
the  
night  
with  
him  
so  
that  
his  
mom  
knew  
that  
there  
was  
somebody  
else  
there  
besides  
the  
nurses  
because  
the  
nurses  
can't  
sit  
in  
the  
room  
the  
whole  
night  
that's  
you  
know  
they  
have  
to  
take  
care  
of  
multiple  
patients  
and  
I  
asked  
the  
nurse  
because  
he  
spent  
one  
night  
alone  
before  
I  
went  
and  
took  
care  
of  
him  
and  
I  
asked  
the  
nurse  
and  
she  
said  
he  
was  
just  
pushing  
the  
call  
button  
all  
night  
long  
just  
because  
he  
was  
scared  
and  
lonely  
and  
they're  
coming  
in  
every  
you  
know  
if  
he  
fought  
if  
he  
does  
fall  
asleep  
they  
come  
in  
every  
20  
minutes  
and  
do  
his  
vitals  
and  
wake  
him  
back  
up  
so  
you  
know  
then  
he's  
awake  
again  
and  
you  
know  
when  
you're  
in  
that  
situation  
as  
a  
little  
kid  
it's  
scary  
you  
need  
somebody  
there  
that's  
on  
your  
team  
that's  
there  
to  
support  
you  
and  
advocate  
for  
you  
especially  
the  
ad  
vacations  
because  
kids  
can't  
do  
that  
for  
themselves  
and  
that  
is  
really  
like  
that  
is  
one  
of  
the  
things  
that  
the  
community  
really  
I  
think  
is  
amazing  
at  
around  
here  
that  
advocating  
for  
each  
other  
and  
being  
like  
wait  
a  
second  
no  
that  
shouldn't  
be  
happening  
you  
should  
you  
need  
to  
you  
need  
to  
that's  
a  
red  
flag  
you  
need  
to  
say  
something  
or  
Oh  
I  
experienced  
that  
too  
so  
you  
know  
don't  
worry  
it's  
gonna  
be  
okay  
because  
this  
is  
what  
happens  
you  
know  
I  
went  
through  
it  
you  
know  
it's  
it  
might  
be  
a  
little  
bit  
rocky  
but  
you  
know  
we're  
there  
to  
reassure  
each  
other  
and  
kind  
of  
and  
you  
know  
just  
but  
the  
thing  
of  
it  
is  
is  
there's  
no  
like  
there's  
not  
even  
any  
support  
groups  
for  
families  
like  
this  
around  
and  
I  
asked  
my  
social  
worker  
why  
and  
he  
said  
it  
was  
because  
every  
time  
they  
tried  
to  
create  
one  
not  
enough  
people  
who  
would  
show  
up  
because  
everybody's  
gotten  
all  
the  
different  
doctor's  
appointments  
all  
over  
the  
place  
so  
if  
there  
was  
a  
place  
like  
ladybug  
house  
where  
you  
could  
all  
go  
and  
come  
together  
and  
you  
know  
you  
drop-in  
there's  
always  
people  
there  
there's  
always  
somebody  
that  
you  
can  
go  
and  
be  
like  
I  
need  
to  
vent  
or  
I  
need  
to  
be  
by  
myself  
or  
I  
need  
somebody  
to  
play  
with  
my  
child  
for  
five  
minutes  
so  
that  
I  
can  
go  
a  
little  
and  
cry  
my  
eyes  
out  
in  
the  
bathroom  
so  
that  
she  
doesn't  
have  
to  
see  
that  
or  
like  
if  
you  
like  
the  
teenagers  
you  
know  
if  
you're  
you  
know  
17  
16  
17  
18  
years  
old  
you  
get  
diagnosed  
with  
cancer  
you  
find  
out  
you  
have  
to  
you  
know  
you're  
in  
the  
hospital  
for  
the  
first  
month  
your  
parent  
is  
by  
your  
bedside  
all  
the  
time  
you  
are  
used  
to  
having  
your  
independence  
that  
you've  
just  
started  
to  
get  
and  
now  
it's  
taken  
from  
you  
like  
that  
and  
you're  
also  
super  
sick  
so  
kids  
like  
that  
they  
need  
a  
place  
to  
go  
and  
be  
able  
to  
be  
cared  
for  
where  
their  
parents  
don't  
have  
to  
worry  
about  
them  
and  
they  
can  
have  
a  
little  
bit  
of  
space  
so  
that  
they  
can  
heal  
better  
because  
you  
feel  
better  
when  
you  
are  
after  
all  
when  
you  
feel  
comforted  
when  
you  
have  
support  
when  
you  
have  
you  
know  
a  
group  
of  
people  
that  
cares  
that's  
around  
you  
that's  
you  
know  
rooting  
for  
you  
and  
a  
team  
kind  
of  
thing  
sorry  
I  
know  
I'm  
like  
all  
over  
the  
well  
my  
daughter  
evolved  
fortunately  
for  
me  
my  
I  
had  
just  
had  
a  
baby  
six  
months  
before  
my  
daughter  
got  
diagnosed  
so  
I  
was  
already  
staying  
at  
home  
so  
that  
was  
fortunate  
and  
my  
husband  
makes  
enough  
money  
so  
that  
we  
can  
get  
by  
parent  
and  
you  
know  
just  
by  
the  
skin  
of  
our  
teeth  
but  
yeah  
so  
I'm  
sorry  
what  
was  
what  
yeah  
yeah  
so  
basically  
like  
I  
said  
before  
like  
they  
make  
us  
less  
of  
appointments  
for  
you  
so  
you're  
like  
okay  
I  
have  
to  
so  
here  
they  
give  
you  
like  
a  
sheet  
and  
it  
has  
your  
appointment  
lists  
on  
it  
and  
you're  
like  
okay  
so  
I'm  
gonna  
be  
at  
the  
hospital  
on  
this  
day  
on  
this  
day  
on  
this  
day  
on  
this  
day  
and  
it's  
like  
you  
go  
in  
you  
they  
access  
support  
that's  
very  
traumatic  
because  
the  
needle  
that  
they  
use  
looks  
like  
one  
of  
those  
safety  
tags  
that  
they  
put  
on  
clothing  
that  
time  
so  
people  
won't  
steal  
it  
that's  
what  
it  
looks  
like  
to  
me  
and  
it  
they  
connect  
to  
that  
in  
there  
and  
so  
then  
they  
draw  
blood  
and  
they  
it  
goes  
off  
to  
the  
lab  
and  
then  
you  
have  
to  
wait  
for  
an  
hour  
and  
then  
you  
go  
in  
and  
you  
have  
your  
vitals  
done  
and  
then  
you  
wait  
for  
the  
doctor  
and  
then  
the  
doctor  
comes  
in  
you  
meet  
with  
the  
doctor  
and  
he  
tells  
you  
you  
know  
what  
your  
daughter's  
what  
my  
daughter's  
an  
SI  
is  
which  
is  
basically  
the  
number  
that  
determines  
whether  
or  
not  
she  
can  
be  
in  
public  
or  
if  
she  
has  
to  
be  
in  
isolation  
or  
what  
so  
and  
she  
has  
to  
right  
now  
she  
has  
to  
have  
that  
every  
two  
weeks  
but  
at  
first  
it  
was  
a  
weekly  
and  
sometimes  
as  
many  
times  
as  
three  
times  
a  
week  
of  
going  
in  
and  
same  
thing  
every  
time  
just  
having  
it  
checked  
or  
having  
going  
into  
a  
sleepy  
room  
and  
having  
them  
do  
they  
put  
her  
to  
sleep  
for  
15  
minutes  
and  
then  
they  
do  
a  
lumbar  
puncture  
which  
is  
basically  
a  
spinal  
tap  
and  
they  
take  
out  
some  
spinal  
fluid  
to  
check  
to  
see  
if  
she's  
got  
the  
any  
leukemia  
cells  
in  
her  
spinal  
fluid  
and  
so  
every  
time  
they  
do  
that  
I  
get  
anxiety  
because  
I'm  
like  
is  
there  
gonna  
be  
is  
there  
gonna  
be  
cells  
this  
time  
thankfully  
she  
has  
not  
ever  
had  
any  
and  
hope  
in  
her  
spinal  
fluid  
but  
I  
it's  
still  
you  
it's  
like  
because  
you  
hear  
stories  
about  
other  
kids  
and  
you  
hear  
stories  
about  
kids  
that  
ever  
relapsed  
more  
than  
once  
or  
and  
so  
it's  
it's  
hard  
well  
there's  
I  
would  
definitely  
say  
a  
far  
greater  
positive  
change  
at  
least  
for  
me  
and  
has  
been  
you  
there's  
a  
great  
community  
here  
in  
Seattle  
of  
cancer  
parents  
and  
we  
all  
have  
we're  
all  
on  
the  
with  
Paige  
together  
and  
we  
you  
know  
you  
can  
go  
on  
there  
anytime  
day  
or  
night  
and  
be  
like  
hey  
you  
know  
you  
can  
vent  
you  
can  
ask  
a  
question  
you  
can  
you  
know  
just  
if  
you  
need  
to  
just  
say  
hi  
or  
people  
will  
go  
on  
there  
and  
say  
hey  
I'm  
gonna  
come  
into  
the  
clinic  
today  
does  
anybody  
in  
an  
impatient  
need  
anything  
and  
it's  
just  
really  
cool  
because  
it's  
like  
everybody  
wants  
to  
support  
each  
other  
and  
everybody  
wants  
to  
make  
sure  
that  
the  
person  
next  
to  
them  
is  
okay  
I  
feel  
like  
and  
it  
really  
like  
going  
through  
this  
kind  
of  
a  
thing  
it  
when  
you  
meet  
somebody  
else  
that's  
been  
through  
it  
to  
you  
it  
you  
you're  
immediately  
bonded  
because  
it's  
such  
a  
significant  
thing  
and  
nobody  
else  
gets  
it  
except  
for  
the  
people  
who  
have  
been  
through  
it  
and  
so  
when  
you  
meet  
somebody  
else  
who's  
been  
through  
it  
it's  
like  
almost  
an  
instant  
bond  
and  
you  
know  
and  
you  
know  
you  
who  
want  
to  
support  
each  
other  
and  
there's  
just  
a  
huge  
great  
you  
know  
network  
of  
parents  
and  
families  
that  
are  
they're  
out  
there  
supporting  
each  
other  
helping  
each  
other  
out  
in  
different  
ways  
all  
the  
time  
and  
but  
there's  
also  
the  
the  
bad  
side  
of  
it  
where  
some  
people  
just  
it's  
too  
much  
for  
them  
like  
they  
don't  
want  
to  
see  
they  
don't  
want  
to  
see  
a  
sick  
kid  
they  
don't  
want  
to  
witness  
your  
child  
possibly  
dying  
even  
if  
they're  
you  
know  
waiting  
for  
your  
best  
friends  
it  
could  
be  
I  
mean  
actually  
my  
best  
friend  
that  
I  
had  
had  
since  
high  
school  
she's  
an  
RN  
and  
she  
never  
has  
called  
me  
since  
I  
and  
it  
was  
I  
actually  
posted  
it  
on  
Facebook  
because  
I  
couldn't  
I  
couldn't  
bring  
myself  
to  
call  
anyone  
and  
tell  
them  
and  
she  
never  
called  
me  
she  
never  
and  
I  
was  
just  
like  
you're  
a  
nurse  
I  
thought  
you'd  
be  
and  
one  
of  
my  
best  
friends  
for  
so  
many  
years  
I  
thought  
you'd  
be  
one  
of  
the  
first  
people  
to  
call  
me  
and  
it  
it's  
shocking  
like  
because  
you  
it's  
people  
that  
you  
would  
never  
expect  
and  
then  
but  
then  
at  
the  
same  
time  
people  
come  
out  
of  
the  
woodwork  
that  
are  
that  
you  
don't  
know  
that  
want  
to  
help  
you  
that  
want  
to  
be  
do  
the  
things  
that  
you  
thought  
the  
irreal  
that's  
for  
it  
was  
gonna  
do  
you  
know  
so  
I  
mean  
in  
that  
way  
it's  
really  
awesome  
I've  
I've  
met  
some  
people  
that  
are  
definitely  
like  
family  
now  
and  
the  
nurses  
as  
well  
are  
because  
you're  
around  
them  
so  
much  
and  
they  
they  
they  
love  
those  
kids  
it's  
very  
clear  
the  
nurses  
that  
Seattle  
Children's  
are  
amazing  
and  
they  
love  
the  
children  
and  
it's  
very  
apparent  
and  
that  
helps  
that  
helps  
and  
that  
is  
another  
part  
of  
the  
community  
to  
as  
the  
nurses  
and  
the  
staff  
the  
doctors  
and  
the  
way  
that  
they  
treat  
the  
kids  
the  
social  
workers  
the  
research  
the  
people  
that  
run  
the  
research  
programs  
that  
come  
in  
and  
talk  
to  
you  
like  
everyone  
they  
just  
all  
have  
such  
great  
manner  
of  
bedside  
manner  
and  
just  
really  
like  
it's  
just  
it's  
an  
awesome  
we're  
really  
fortunate  
to  
be  
in  
I  
mean  
this  
is  
a  
horrible  
situation  
but  
this  
is  
the  
best  
place  
to  
have  
it  
happen  
how  
do  
you  
think  
how  
do  
you  
think  
ladybug  
house  
can  
provide  
a  
better  
experience  
what  
do  
you  
see  
I  
see  
people  
utilizing  
that  
so  
much  
because  
you  
you  
need  
a  
place  
if  
especially  
if  
you're  
coming  
from  
you  
know  
somewhere  
far  
away  
and  
you're  
not  
you  
don't  
have  
your  
house  
you  
need  
a  
place  
where  
you  
can  
go  
and  
you  
can  
relax  
and  
rest  
and  
you  
know  
that  
there's  
somebody  
there  
in  
case  
if  
your  
child  
suddenly  
becomes  
ill  
because  
you  
that's  
constantly  
on  
your  
mind  
to  
is  
I  
have  
to  
stay  
within  
an  
hour  
of  
the  
hospital  
isn't  
my  
daughter  
going  
to  
spike  
fever  
if  
if  
she  
does  
I  
have  
to  
get  
her  
to  
the  
hospital  
within  
an  
hour  
and  
so  
you  
know  
it's  
I'm  
sorry  
I  
kind  
of  
went  
away  
from  
your  
original  
what  
what  
was  
your  
original  
you  
want  
oh  
so  
yeah  
so  
basically  
I  
think  
people  
will  
be  
able  
to  
go  
there  
and  
rest  
and  
you  
know  
just  
actually  
rest  
and  
not  
be  
woken  
up  
every  
20  
minutes  
by  
a  
nurse  
coming  
in  
to  
do  
vitals  
or  
whatever  
but  
still  
know  
that  
your  
child  
is  
going  
to  
be  
okay  
or  
if  
you  
have  
a  
teenager  
and  
they're  
your  
teenager  
like  
I  
was  
saying  
earlier  
if  
your  
teenager  
needs  
a  
break  
from  
you  
from  
the  
and  
they're  
not  
they  
don't  
need  
to  
be  
in  
the  
hospital  
you  
know  
they  
can  
go  
there  
they  
can  
stay  
they  
can  
you're  
the  
child  
the  
parents  
know  
that  
they're  
gonna  
be  
okay  
and  
there  
it  
helps  
them  
get  
a  
little  
bit  
of  
a  
recharge  
a  
reboost  
you  
know  
to  
you  
know  
be  
away  
from  
their  
parents  
you  
know  
just  
relax  
not  
have  
to  
worry  
about  
them  
being  
constantly  
sitting  
right  
next  
to  
them  
and  
worrying  
about  
them  
and  
asking  
them  
all  
these  
questions  
about  
how  
they're  
feeling  
and  
so  
it's  
I  
mean  
it's  
gonna  
be  
so  
valuable  
and  
then  
you  
know  
families  
that  
need  
a  
place  
for  
further  
child  
to  
go  
and  
and  
be  
if  
they're  
really  
sick  
and  
you  
know  
they  
need  
care  
and  
the  
parents  
don't  
have  
they  
can't  
get  
them  
to  
back  
to  
their  
house  
and  
they  
want  
to  
take  
them  
there  
and  
and  
just  
you  
know  
let  
nature  
take  
its  
its  
course  
if  
that's  
what  
is  
gonna  
happen  
and  
and  
you  
know  
just  
it's  
it's  
gonna  
be  
it's  
gonna  
be  
so  
great  
and  
I  
think  
that  
it's  
gonna  
be  
good  
because  
of  
the  
fact  
that  
there's  
going  
to  
be  
nurses  
and  
and  
doctors  
there  
and  
then  
the  
community  
of  
Seattle  
just  
the  
families  
I  
mean  
when  
as  
soon  
as  
it's  
all  
together  
it's  
gonna  
be  
awesome  
like  
the  
support  
will  
be  
so  
great  
for  
for  
the  
families  
to  
be  
able  
to  
know  
that  
they  
have  
this  
place  
that  
it's  
there  
if  
you're  
freaking  
out  
if  
you're  
at  
home  
and  
you're  
like  
oh  
my  
gosh  
my  
five-year-old  
she  
just  
pump  
ins  
on  
steroids  
for  
a  
month  
she's  
will  
not  
stop  
screaming  
at  
me  
she's  
eating  
every  
two  
minutes  
I  
need  
to  
go  
stay  
there  
and  
have  
somebody  
else  
help  
me  
watch  
her  
because  
I  
just  
need  
a  
little  
bit  
of  
a  
break  
you  
know  
and  
that  
little  
bit  
of  
a  
recharge  
sometimes  
that  
is  
the  
difference  
between  
melting  
down  
and  
losing  
it  
and  
being  
able  
to  
pull  
yourself  
together  
and  
get  
through  
it  
so  
I  
mean  
it's  
invaluable  
it's  
there's  
you  
can't  
put  
a  
price  
on  
it  
the  
being  
able  
to  
go  
there  
and  
just  
know  
that  
everything  
is  
going  
to  
be  
okay  
and  
you  
can  
relax  
and  
you  
can  
recharge  
if  
that's  
what  
you  
need  
to  
do  
or  
you  
can  
go  
there  
and  
rest  
you  
know  
be  
happy  
you  
do  
fun  
stuff  
dewy  
from  
the  
hospital  
so  
yeah

she  
was  
four  
months  
old  
when  
she  
was  
diagnosed  
and  
initially  
she  
the  
way  
we  
found  
out  
was  
she  
had  
her  
soft  
spot  
was  
bulging  
and  
we  
took  
her  
to  
four  
different  
doctors  
and  
they  
were  
like  
you  
know  
it's  
normal  
for  
a  
baby  
to  
be  
like  
that  
and  
eventually  
we  
ended  
up  
taking  
her  
to  
the  
ER  
when  
they  
found  
a  
brain  
tumor  
and  
within  
six  
hours  
she  
was  
in  
surgery  
in  
surgery  
lasted  
nine  
and  
a  
half  
hours  
and  
they  
removed  
a  
tumor  
that  
was  
half  
the  
size  
of  
her  
brain  
and  
from  
there  
you  
know  
like  
your  
whole  
your  
whole  
world  
changes  
everything's  
different  
you  
know  
we  
weren't  
sure  
that  
she  
would  
survive  
the  
surgery  
the  
chances  
of  
her  
walking  
were  
slim  
the  
chances  
of  
her  
moving  
or  
breathing  
on  
her  
own  
were  
minimal  
and  
you  
know  
this  
kid  
just  
proved  
doctors  
wrong  
from  
the  
get-go  
everything  
she  
rolled  
over  
when  
she  
was  
supposed  
to  
she  
walked  
when  
she  
was  
supposed  
to  
everything  
that  
she  
was  
wasn't  
supposed  
to  
do  
she  
did  
and  
you  
know  
if  
she  
was  
she  
was  
our  
little  
miracle  
baby  
and  
she  
at  
three  
months  
later  
after  
the  
initial  
removal  
her  
tumor  
grew  
back  
again  
this  
time  
to  
astrocytoma  
so  
she  
went  
into  
chemotherapy  
at  
eight  
months  
old  
and  
she  
did  
a  
total  
of  
28  
rounds  
of  
chemo  
42  
days  
of  
radiation  
and  
she  
had  
17  
surgeries  
in  
four  
years  
of  
life  
a  
Nellie  
passed  
away  
January  
15th  
of  
this  
year  
and  
so  
throughout  
all  
of  
medical  
procedures  
can  
you  
describe  
what  
it  
was  
like  
for  
you  
and  
your  
family  
did  
you  
have  
to  
but  
were  
you  
living  
nearby  
oh  
we  
had  
a  
that  
was  
place  
did  
you  
go  
back  
and  
forth  
to  
take  
us  
through  
that  
um  
so  
we  
live  
two  
hours  
from  
Seattle  
Children's  
so  
we  
commuted  
all  
the  
time  
you  
know  
Elliot  
was  
le  
pretty  
much  
lived  
in  
the  
hospital  
so  
my  
other  
daughter  
was  
cared  
for  
by  
family  
and  
so  
you  
know  
we  
had  
a  
lot  
of  
support  
but  
it  
was  
extremely  
hard  
on  
our  
family  
we  
couldn't  
be  
together  
my  
husband  
had  
to  
work  
to  
keep  
our  
home  
and  
you  
know  
to  
keep  
finances  
going  
and  
so  
we  
were  
traveling  
two  
hours  
every  
single  
day  
to  
appointments  
and  
it  
was  
extremely  
hard  
we  
spent  
most  
of  
the  
time  
in  
a  
hospital  
and  
most  
of  
the  
time  
away  
from  
our  
oldest  
daughter  
yeah  
and  
can  
you  
so  
let's  
just  
say  
that  
for  
families  
who  
don't  
live  
within  
two  
hours  
what  
do  
you  
think  
I  
mean  
if  
we  
had  
to  
travel  
further  
than  
to  
I  
mean  
most  
most  
patients  
live  
you  
know  
like  
at  
Ronald  
McDonald  
Houses  
and  
and  
stuff  
like  
that  
and  
and  
that  
alone  
is  
really  
hard  
you  
can't  
have  
especially  
for  
single  
moms  
you  
can't  
have  
your  
other  
kids  
in  
the  
hospital  
room  
with  
you  
so  
you  
have  
to  
leave  
your  
sick  
child  
alone  
in  
a  
hospital  
room  
by  
themselves  
while  
you're  
at  
a  
Ronald  
McDonald  
across  
the  
street  
from  
the  
hospital  
you  
know  
not  
knowing  
what's  
happening  
to  
your  
other  
child  
the  
one  
that  
needs  
you  
the  
most  
you  
can't  
even  
be  
there  
with  
and  
so  
that's  
really  
hard  
on  
families  
you  
know  
you're  
stuck  
in  
a  
position  
where  
you  
want  
to  
be  
in  
two  
places  
at  
once  
and  
you  
can't  
and  
was  
it  
like  
that  
yeah  
so  
you're  
saying  
that  
you  
can't  
there's  
times  
when  
you  
can't  
be  
yeah  
can  
you  
continue  
to  
take  
us  
through  
that  
um  
so  
in  
our  
in  
our  
case  
my  
oldest  
daughter  
we  
pretty  
much  
relied  
on  
other  
family  
to  
care  
for  
her  
because  
I  
couldn't  
have  
her  
staying  
in  
the  
hospital  
with  
us  
so  
you're  
only  
allowed  
you  
know  
an  
adult  
and  
the  
sick  
child  
in  
the  
hospital  
room  
and  
so  
you're  
stuck  
in  
a  
position  
where  
you  
either  
have  
to  
be  
with  
your  
not  
sick  
kid  
or  
your  
sick  
kid  
you  
know  
and  
you  
know  
my  
husband's  
working  
and  
so  
we  
had  
to  
basically  
have  
family  
watcher  
all  
the  
time  
you  
know  
and  
she  
spent  
most  
of  
the  
last  
four  
years  
away  
from  
her  
dad  
and  
me  
and  
so  
that's  
really  
hard  
on  
a  
family  
to  
be  
broken  
up  
you  
know  
I  
mean  
emotionally  
you're  
already  
so  
distraught  
from  
what  
you're  
going  
through  
physically  
and  
just  
to  
be  
just  
to  
have  
that  
put  
on  
you  
you  
know  
and  
even  
in  
Ellie's  
death  
it  
was  
extremely  
hard  
not  
having  
hospice  
care  
in  
our  
home  
we  
live  
we  
live  
outside  
of  
King  
County  
we're  
in  
Pierce  
County  
and  
there's  
no  
hospice  
for  
children  
um  
so  
basically  
it  
relied  
on  
me  
being  
her  
caregiver  
24/7  
and  
it  
got  
to  
the  
point  
where  
I  
had  
to  
call  
my  
mom  
and  
my  
aunt  
in  
because  
I  
couldn't  
care  
for  
her  
24/7  
her  
meds  
around  
the  
clock  
were  
too  
much  
for  
me  
to  
handle  
so  
basically  
I  
had  
to  
outsource  
and  
the  
only  
people  
I  
could  
get  
were  
you  
know  
my  
mom  
and  
my  
aunt  
to  
come  
help  
and  
you  
know  
it's  
hard  
especially  
watching  
your  
kid  
pass  
away  
but  
to  
have  
to  
be  
there  
for  
her  
and  
be  
her  
caretaker  
is  
even  
harder  
yeah  
yes  
what's  
your  
my  
biggest  
motivator  
is  
so  
when  
Ellie  
after  
Ellie  
passed  
away  
it  
was  
pretty  
traumatizing  
for  
a  
family  
basically  
what  
happens  
when  
you  
don't  
have  
hospice  
care  
and  
your  
kid  
passes  
away  
in  
your  
home  
you  
have  
to  
call  
9-1-1  
you  
have  
people  
come  
to  
your  
house  
attach  
your  
kid  
to  
wires  
after  
she's  
already  
passed  
and  
you  
try  
to  
restart  
her  
heart  
and  
it's  
something  
that's  
supposed  
to  
be  
peaceful  
and  
it's  
supposed  
to  
I  
mean  
we  
already  
knew  
she  
was  
gone  
and  
to  
have  
hooked  
up  
to  
more  
wires  
after  
that  
it  
hurts  
and  
you  
have  
policemen  
and  
um  
you  
know  
people  
and  
ambulances  
coming  
through  
your  
door  
and  
and  
it's  
it's  
hard  
to  
watch  
people  
who  
don't  
know  
you  
look  
at  
your  
kid  
and  
just  
it's  
just  
really  
hard  
it's  
traumatizing  
to  
watch  
your  
husband  
carry  
a  
dead  
lifeless  
body  
outside  
onto  
a  
stretcher  
because  
those  
are  
your  
only  
options  
you  
know  
we  
painted  
her  
nails  
and  
we  
we  
took  
her  
out  
and  
watching  
her  
leave  
in  
that  
car  
there's  
one  
of  
the  
hardest  
things  
I  
ever  
had  
to  
do  
to  
know  
that  
you  
never  
get  
to  
see  
her  
baby  
again  
that's  
it's  
rough  
and  
that's  
why  
we  
need  
ladybug  
house  
is  
because  
my  
family  
shouldn't  
have  
had  
to  
be  
traumatized  
like  
that  
we  
shouldn't  
have  
had  
to  
watch  
her  
be  
hooked  
up  
to  
wires  
for  
them  
to  
tell  
that  
her  
heart  
wasn't  
beating  
because  
I  
saw  
her  
take  
her  
last  
breath  
we  
shouldn't  
have  
to  
be  
forced  
to  
give  
and  
work  
around  
the  
clock  
to  
give  
her  
medication  
that  
should  
be  
something  
that  
people  
are  
willing  
to  
help  
with  
I  
shouldn't  
have  
to  
call  
the  
police  
because  
my  
daughter  
died  
in  
home  
I  
shouldn't  
have  
to  
wonder  
whether  
I'm  
gonna  
cremate  
or  
bury  
my  
child  
those  
options  
should  
be  
handed  
to  
me  
and  
I  
should  
have  
I  
should  
have  
options  
the  
whole  
experience  
was  
so  
hard  
because  
we  
knew  
nothing  
we  
were  
not  
prepared  
for  
her  
death  
we  
didn't  
know  
if  
we  
were  
gonna  
cremate  
or  
bury  
we  
didn't  
know  
that  
when  
you  
went  
to  
a  
funeral  
place  
they  
call  
it  
looking  
for  
property  
like  
you're  
buying  
a  
damn  
house  
it's  
not  
it's  
not  
okay  
these  
options  
should  
be  
there  
and  
they  
should  
be  
talked  
about  
and  
death  
is  
always  
hidden  
from  
in  
the  
community  
it's  
always  
but  
it's  
inevitable  
it's  
gonna  
happen  
to  
everybody  
and  
being  
prepared  
is  
better  
than  
not  
being  
prepared  
she  
was  
taking  
a  
lot  
of  
home  
yeah  
tell  
us  
why  
you  
transition  
well  
she  
was  
put  
on  
palliative  
care  
after  
she  
relapsed  
again  
which  
was  
at  
the  
end  
of  
December  
and  
we  
ended  
up  
taking  
her  
home  
because  
hospitals  
no  
place  
for  
a  
kid  
to  
be  
because  
being  
away  
from  
her  
family  
and  
being  
two  
hours  
away  
from  
where  
her  
home  
is  
we  
couldn't  
have  
her  
sister  
couldn't  
stay  
the  
night  
with  
her  
in  
the  
hospital  
you  
know  
and  
that's  
not  
fair  
to  
her  
you  
know  
her  
sister  
watched  
as  
she  
took  
her  
last  
breath  
and  
that's  
how  
it  
should  
be  
you  
know  
what  
I  
mean  
she  
should  
be  
able  
to  
have  
make  
the  
choice  
to  
watch  
her  
sister  
you  
know  
she  
watch  
her  
sister  
come  
into  
the  
world  
she  
can  
watch  
her  
go  
out  
and  
she  
made  
that  
choice  
herself  
and  
that's  
no  
choice  
that  
an  
eight-year-old  
should  
have  
to  
make  
but  
at  
the  
same  
time  
like  
having  
having  
her  
home  
was  
very  
important  
to  
us  
having  
having  
a  
place  
for  
us  
to  
be  
there  
when  
she  
took  
her  
last  
breath  
was  
very  
important  
to  
us  
being  
in  
a  
hospital  
where  
she's  
hooked  
up  
to  
wires  
and  
stuff  
like  
it's  
just  
not  
it's  
not  
where  
you  
want  
your  
kid  
to  
be  
when  
they're  
passing  
away  
you  
want  
them  
to  
be  
comfortable  
you  
want  
your  
family  
to  
be  
around  
you  
want  
to  
have  
the  
option  
of  
having  
your  
your  
animals  
with  
you  
and  
you  
know  
like  
her  
pets  
you  
know  
and  
you  
know  
you  
don't  
it's  
just  
it's  
just  
something  
we  
wanted  
as  
a  
family  
we  
didn't  
want  
her  
in  
a  
hospital  
she  
spent  
the  
last  
four  
years  
of  
her  
life  
in  
a  
hospital  
we  
didn't  
want  
her  
passing  
away  
in  
a  
hospital  
wasn't  
fair  
to  
her  
and  
what  
were  
some  
memorable  
moments  
she  
slept  
for  
most  
of  
her  
last  
few  
months  
but  
a  
few  
days  
before  
she  
passed  
she  
she  
was  
up  
and  
finger-painting  
with  
us  
and  
we  
painted  
her  
nails  
and  
we  
you  
know  
she  
she  
knew  
how  
much  
we  
loved  
her  
and  
we  
talked  
about  
how  
brave  
she  
was  
and  
how  
many  
people  
and  
she  
inspired  
and  
just  
what  
a  
remarkable  
girl  
she  
was  
you  
know  
we  
didn't  
have  
a  
lot  
of  
super  
awesome  
memories  
in  
the  
end  
because  
she  
you  
know  
she  
was  
sleeping  
all  
the  
time  
but  
that  
just  
you  
know  
allowed  
for  
me  
to  
hold  
her  
more  
often  
and  
cuddle  
her  
more  
often  
and  
and  
so  
that  
was  
nice  
for  
me  
to  
be  
able  
to  
hold  
her  
and  
her  
not  
yell  
at  
me  
and  
tell  
me  
to  
let  
it  
go  
so  
you  
know  
and  
any  
words  
to  
families  
who  
really  
fortunate  
enough  
to  
not  
never  
go  
through  
that  
just  
in  
weather  
in  
terms  
of  
support  
or  
something  
that  
you  
wish  
that  
they  
were  
understand  
um  
as  
far  
as  
like  
other  
families  
and  
stuff  
that  
I  
wish  
they'd  
understand  
I  
wish  
that  
people  
would  
after  
your  
kid  
passes  
you're  
stuck  
in  
this  
world  
where  
people  
don't  
know  
what  
to  
say  
to  
you  
they  
don't  
know  
how  
to  
treat  
you  
they  
don't  
know  
what  
to  
say  
they  
don't  
come  
around  
because  
they're  
scared  
they'll  
offend  
you  
and  
it's  
very  
isolating  
and  
very  
lonely  
so  
having  
you  
know  
and  
that's  
why  
I  
support  
ladybug  
house  
so  
much  
is  
because  
having  
support  
is  
what  
you  
need  
you  
know  
we've  
been  
thankful  
enough  
to  
have  
so  
many  
friends  
and  
family  
that  
have  
been  
there  
for  
us  
but  
it  
you  
know  
people  
that  
don't  
have  
it  
it's  
it's  
really  
hard  
and  
not  
having  
support  
and  
not  
having  
somebody  
there  
to  
talk  
to  
is  
is  
some  
of  
the  
hardest  
stuff  
to  
get  
through  
so  
my  
biggest  
thing  
is  
make  
sure  
you  
talk  
to  
somebody  
find  
someone  
who  
understands  
another  
mom  
who's  
been  
through  
what  
you  
went  
through  
or  
a  
place  
like  
ladybug  
house  
and  
where  
you  
can  
get  
counseling  
or  
get  
help  
after  
the  
fact  
you  
know  
somebody  
there  
that's  
there  
to  
support  
you  
and  
help  
you  
through  
your  
journey  
because  
you  
know  
you  
go  
through  
we  
went  
through  
four  
years  
of  
hardship  
and  
now  
we're  
gonna  
go  
through  
a  
lifetime  
of  
even  
harder  
and  
so  
you  
know  
these  
moms  
that  
go  
through  
the  
unthinkable  
cancer  
treatments  
and  
and  
all  
that  
stuff  
it's  
awful  
but  
you  
get  
to  
leave  
cancer  
treatment  
with  
your  
kid  
when  
your  
kid  
passes  
you're  
left  
with  
nothing  
you're  
left  
in  
this  
this  
dark  
world  
where  
nothing  
makes  
sense  
anymore  
and  
everything  
you  
lived  
for  
is  
now  
gone  
and  
so  
it's  
it's  
really  
hard  
and  
you  
need  
you  
need  
support  
from  
all  
angles  
so  
and  
you  
talk  
about  
the  
support  
that  
you've  
had  
with  
probably  
friends  
and  
family  
can  
you  
take  
a  
such  
as  
specific  
moments  
where  
you  
know  
where  
you  
had  
that  
and  
how  
that  
maybe  
changed  
the  
way  
you  
viewed  
her  
or  
your  
situation  
um  
I  
mean  
all  
throughout  
our  
daughter's  
journey  
we've  
had  
such  
a  
remarkable  
community  
stand  
behind  
us  
that  
even  
like  
when  
she  
was  
taking  
her  
last  
breaths  
we  
talked  
about  
all  
the  
lives  
she  
changed  
how  
many  
how  
many  
people  
she  
changed  
and  
how  
much  
enjoy  
she  
brought  
to  
the  
world  
all  
the  
fun  
things  
we  
had  
done  
in  
her  
life  
and  
and  
having  
all  
those  
people  
stand  
behind  
us  
is  
probably  
one  
of  
the  
best  
things  
could  
have  
ever  
happened  
to  
us  
I  
mean  
literally  
support  
is  
the  
best  
thing  
that  
we  
could  
have  
ever  
asked  
for  
and  
just  
because  
having  
people  
stand  
behind  
you  
and  
tell  
you  
that  
you're  
doing  
an  
amazing  
job  
that  
you're  
you  
know  
even  
though  
you  
just  
went  
through  
one  
of  
the  
hardest  
things  
in  
your  
whole  
entire  
life  
you're  
still  
out  
there  
and  
you're  
still  
doing  
things  
in  
honor  
of  
her  
and  
just  
having  
people  
stand  
behind  
you  
helping  
you  
do  
that  
is  
is  
huge  
so  
we've  
had  
nicole  
has  
pretty  
much  
been  
my  
rock  
through  
all  
of  
this  
you  
are  
faced  
with  
so  
much  
anger  
and  
hate  
towards  
everyone  
and  
everything  
I  
thought  
about  
killing  
myself  
a  
bunch  
of  
times  
and  
if  
it  
wasn't  
for  
her  
keeping  
me  
busy  
doing  
things  
and  
keeping  
my  
head  
on  
my  
shoulders  
and  
having  
somebody  
to  
talk  
to  
and  
and  
act  
like  
you  
know  
things  
are  
normal  
things  
are  
back  
to  
the  
way  
they  
were  
and  
to  
be  
able  
to  
talk  
to  
her  
with  
you  
know  
talk  
to  
her  
like  
my  
kids  
still  
here  
has  
been  
huge  
for  
me  
it's  
been  
a  
huge  
support  
and  
yeah  
I  
hope  
other  
people  
can  
find  
support  
like  
that  
when  
they  
go  
through  
something  
like  
that  
cuz  
doesn't  
come  
easy  
you  
should  
come  
in  
and  
see  
I  
shouldn't  
wouldn't  
I  
know  
I  
tried  
to  
make  
you  
but  
you  
know  
she  
Nicole  
actually  
that's  
just  
transitioning  
what  
was  
it  
for  
Sarah  
what  
was  
it  
for  
you  
to  
meet  
Sarah  
like  
what  
was  
that  
experience  
like  
her  
saying  
that  
how  
does  
that  
make  
you  
feel  
because  
even  
though  
she's  
been  
going  
through  
even  
through  
those  
hard  
times  
for  
her  
she  
was  
still  
my  
rock  
with  
what  
I'm  
going  
through  
with  
my  
own  
kids  
so  
I  
feel  
like  
it's  
kind  
of  
like  
a  
balance  
like  
when  
I  
have  
days  
that  
I  
don't  
want  
to  
get  
out  
of  
bed  
she  
doesn't  
make  
it  
an  
option  
she  
just  
comes  
against  
me  
and  
when  
she's  
like  
that  
I  
just  
go  
and  
get  
her  
so  
it's  
kind  
of  
been  
like  
um  
a  
balance  
and  
I  
think  
that  
we  
need  
more  
people  
like  
her  
in  
this  
world  
she  
had  
the  
kids  
were  
so  
many  
kids  
outside  
of  
the  
cancer  
world  
and  
the  
cancer  
world  
and  
she's  
just  
made  
such  
a  
big  
impact  
on  
the  
whole  
community  
and  
the  
I've  
met  
so  
many  
wonderful  
people  
because  
of  
her  
and  
she's  
gonna  
do  
big  
things  
for  
kids  
around  
the  
world  
and  
can  
you  
give  
me  
some  
specific  
moments  
where  
you  
felt  
something  
heartfelt  
because  
of  
you  
to  
meeting  
an  
interaction  
or  
memories  
shared  
well  
so  
the  
first  
kind  
of  
time  
we  
met  
we  
met  
at  
Seattle  
Children's  
and  
I  
kind  
of  
just  
said  
it's  
your  
daughter  
Ellie  
because  
I  
saw  
something  
on  
Facebook  
about  
postcards  
and  
she  
was  
like  
yeah  
and  
we  
just  
might  
be  
kind  
of  
clicked  
like  
I  
felt  
like  
we  
just  
kind  
of  
had  
this  
like  
cooking  
moment  
and  
not  
day  
was  
the  
day  
that  
my  
daughter  
diagnosed  
with  
Michelle's  
disease  
and  
we  
went  
home  
and  
I  
don't  
know  
if  
it  
was  
that  
night  
or  
the  
next  
night  
but  
we're  
like  
what  
are  
you  
doing  
and  
both  
of  
us  
at  
the  
same  
time  
to  
the  
picture  
like  
a  
pile  
of  
chocolate  
and  
text  
it  
to  
each  
other  
and  
you're  
like  
this  
will  
work  
this  
work  
we're  
having  
a  
bad  
day  
and  
this  
is  
what  
we're  
doing  
we  
just  
it  
just  
kind  
of  
took  
off  
from  
there  
and  
that  
was  
kind  
of  
like  
the  
moment  
that  
I  
realize  
like  
we're  
on  
the  
same  
level  
with  
life  
I  
mean  
yeah  
food  
definitely  
um  
yeah  
I  
think  
we  
just  
definitely  
I  
think  
and  
when  
you're  
when  
you're  
confronted  
with  
illnesses  
with  
your  
kids  
you're  
just  
all  
these  
families  
you  
just  
instantly  
click  
with  
you  
know  
and  
for  
us  
being  
so  
close  
to  
each  
other  
and  
living  
so  
close  
to  
each  
other  
like  
that  
connection  
was  
even  
stronger  
because  
you  
know  
we  
could  
be  
there  
for  
all  
the  
hard  
moments  
and  
we  
can  
help  
each  
other  
out  
when  
you  
know  
like  
if  
there's  
not  
a  
doctor  
there  
to  
talk  
to  
we  
can  
talk  
to  
each  
other  
and  
come  
up  
with  
our  
own  
diagnosis  
for  
our  
kid  
and  
and  
treat  
them  
ourselves  
and  
so  
we  
you  
know  
being  
being  
close  
to  
each  
other's  
been  
a  
huge  
thing  
but  
you  
had  
definitely  
cookies  
and  
chocolate  
that's  
helpful  
and  
I  
think  
the  
kids  
like  
it's  
our  
husbands  
have  
became  
like  
really  
good  
friends  
like  
it's  
not  
even  
just  
us  
it's  
been  
like  
basically  
if  
we  
find  
something  
we  
don't  
plan  
it  
without  
the  
other  
family  
now  
it's  
like  
a  
big  
it's  
just  
like  
one  
big  
family  
like  
we  
cook  
a  
lot  
while  
the  
husband's  
at  
work  
we  
eat  
like  
meals  
together  
and  
basically  
plan  
our  
life  
together  
now  
just  
yeah  
suffering  
what  
would  
it  
be  
like  
if  
ladybug  
house  
was  
there  
I  
mean  
that  
would  
that  
that  
to  
me  
is  
something  
it  
would  
be  
a  
dream  
come  
true  
and  
I  
say  
that  
because  
having  
living  
in  
a  
living  
in  
a  
house  
where  
you  
have  
this  
is  
so  
ideal  
where  
you  
can  
be  
like  
I  
can't  
tonight  
I  
just  
got  
done  
with  
chemo  
can  
you  
make  
something  
for  
my  
family  
and  
you  
know  
and  
they  
you'll  
have  
a  
meal  
made  
when  
you  
get  
home  
or  
you'll  
have  
the  
support  
when  
you  
had  
a  
rough  
day  
at  
clinic  
and  
you'll  
be  
able  
to  
come  
back  
and  
be  
like  
you  
know  
my  
kid  
was  
screaming  
the  
whole  
time  
and  
that  
parent  
sitting  
across  
from  
you  
will  
just  
understand  
it  
and  
get  
exactly  
where  
you  
came  
from  
like  
that's  
huge  
not  
only  
just  
having  
the  
nursing  
support  
and  
the  
staff  
support  
but  
having  
the  
family  
support  
that  
comes  
with  
it  
and  
being  
able  
to  
have  
your  
whole  
family  
there  
and  
that's  
that's  
a  
huge  
thing  
for  
you  
know  
families  
like  
us  
that  
go  
through  
this  
it's  
it's  
really  
hard  
it's  
extremely  
hard  
and  
you  
need  
that  
community  
you  
need  
you  
need  
help  
so  
yeah  
just  
like  
having  
like  
the  
resources  
of  
another  
family  
liek  
you  
know  
like  
if  
she's  
having  
a  
rough  
day  
and  
I  
cook  
dinner  
I  
bring  
her  
husband  
dinner  
for  
work  
and  
it  
works  
both  
ways  
so  
we  
kind  
of  
just  
kind  
of  
like  
you  
learn  
where  
to  
give  
you  
can  
just  
see  
it  
you  
just  
get  
it  
and  
there's  
lots  
of  
things  
that  
other  
parents  
don't  
I  
think  
get  
when  
it  
comes  
to  
living  
this  
kind  
of  
life  
and  
it's  
not  
because  
they  
don't  
care  
and  
we  
don't  
try  
it's  
just  
it's  
a  
different  
reality  
for  
us  
than  
what  
it  
is  
for  
them  
that  
cool  
it's  
a  
good  
it's  
a  
little  
bit

I  
can  
so  
my  
daughter  
Leila  
was  
my  
actually  
my  
husband  
was  
giving  
my  
daughter  
Leila  
a  
diaper  
change  
and  
her  
belly  
flocked  
to  
the  
right  
side  
and  
we  
thought  
that  
it  
could  
be  
liver  
problems  
we  
were  
not  
expecting  
what  
we  
found  
out  
at  
the  
hospital  
that  
day  
so  
we  
went  
to  
the  
clinic  
closest  
to  
our  
home  
and  
they  
did  
an  
ultrasound  
they  
put  
us  
in  
the  
tiniest  
room  
that  
the  
clinic  
has  
and  
Seattle  
Children's  
Hospital  
called  
me  
and  
said  
you  
need  
to  
get  
here  
within  
30  
minutes  
and  
we  
think  
your  
kid  
has  
cancer  
and  
so  
I  
got  
to  
the  
hospital  
for  
marysville  
in  
15  
minutes  
and  
they  
told  
us  
that  
I  
she  
had  
cancer  
it  
was  
the  
size  
of  
a  
grapefruit  
and  
we  
need  
it  
to  
start  
chemo  
tomorrow  
and  
we  
need  
to  
get  
a  
diagnosis  
like  
this  
you  
don't  
you  
don't  
listen  
to  
anything  
that  
the  
doctors  
are  
saying  
you  
can't  
hear  
anything  
when  
they  
say  
cancer  
you  
think  
my  
kids  
are  
gonna  
die  
it's  
my  
fault  
it's  
I  
don't  
know  
what  
to  
do  
I  
have  
a  
little  
boy  
I  
I  
don't  
know  
how  
it  
would  
have  
affected  
him  
and  
a  
few  
days  
later  
she  
had  
a  
biopsy  
of  
her  
tumor  
and  
they  
told  
us  
that  
she  
was  
stage  
for  
high  
risk  
neuroblastoma  
it  
had  
metastasized  
into  
every  
single  
bone  
in  
her  
body  
and  
we  
started  
chemo  
actually  
on  
my  
eighth  
wedding  
anniversary  
so  
that  
was  
in  
2015  
November  
7  
2015  
we  
started  
chemo  
[Music]  
so  
after  
diagnosis  
we  
were  
stuck  
in  
the  
hospital  
for  
quite  
a  
few  
weeks  
going  
through  
chemo  
going  
through  
all  
these  
tests  
all  
these  
things  
that  
the  
doctors  
are  
doing  
and  
we  
were  
in  
the  
hospital  
for  
the  
completion  
of  
her  
treatment  
it  
was  
four  
months  
total  
we  
were  
sleeping  
over  
at  
the  
hospital  
she  
had  
68  
rounds  
of  
chemotherapy  
she  
had  
12  
days  
of  
radiation  
she  
had  
a  
surgery  
a  
couple  
surgeries  
for  
her  
central  
line  
placement  
in  
her  
biopsy  
and  
things  
like  
that  
it  
was  
and  
we  
were  
at  
the  
hospital  
every  
other  
day  
for  
blood  
draws  
lab  
testing  
and  
anytime  
she  
got  
a  
fever  
I  
mean  
we  
lived  
at  
the  
hospital  
for  
a  
year  
and  
a  
half  
basically  
[Music]  
so  
it's  
for  
someone  
who  
doesn't  
know  
what  
that  
process  
is  
like  
that's  
who  
you're  
speaking  
to  
so  
at  
the  
hospital  
there  
when  
you  
get  
stuck  
in  
a  
room  
when  
you're  
inpatient  
at  
the  
hospital  
you  
are  
in  
the  
same  
room  
with  
your  
kid  
and  
in  
the  
back  
of  
the  
room  
there's  
a  
futon  
couch  
it's  
maybe  
three  
inches  
thick  
and  
it  
feels  
like  
plywood  
when  
he  
laid  
out  
and  
you  
can't  
sleep  
there  
you  
I  
mean  
with  
all  
the  
beeping  
and  
the  
noise  
and  
the  
nurses  
coming  
in  
and  
out  
and  
all  
the  
other  
kids  
that  
are  
screaming  
and  
whatever  
they  
have  
to  
do  
you  
have  
to  
just  
lay  
there  
and  
listen  
to  
everything  
and  
it's  
it's  
really  
awful  
and  
it's  
the  
they  
do  
the  
best  
that  
they  
can  
but  
the  
living  
situation  
what  
we  
had  
there  
was  
not  
home  
it  
was  
still  
a  
hospital  
we  
knew  
we  
were  
in  
a  
hospital  
and  
it  
wasn't  
it  
just  
wasn't  
at  
home  
they  
didn't  
feel  
like  
home  
I  
actually  
had  
to  
bring  
in  
an  
air  
mattress  
to  
be  
able  
to  
fall  
asleep  
at  
night  
and  
lay  
it  
on  
top  
of  
the  
futon  
and  
even  
then  
it  
just  
I  
mean  
it  
you  
just  
want  
something  
more  
for  
your  
kid  
for  
yourself  
I  
feel  
like  
if  
I  
had  
gotten  
more  
sleep  
I  
would  
have  
been  
more  
on  
top  
of  
things  
while  
I  
was  
there  
I  
I  
would  
have  
been  
more  
present  
from  
my  
son  
I  
would  
have  
been  
more  
present  
for  
my  
husband  
or  
my  
daughter  
but  
it's  
just  
hard  
when  
it's  
not  
home  
the  
idea  
of  
ladybug  
house  
and  
what  
we  
want  
it  
to  
look  
like  
we  
want  
it  
to  
be  
a  
home  
we  
want  
it  
to  
have  
a  
regular  
mattress  
we  
want  
things  
that  
would  
make  
it  
feel  
like  
it  
is  
our  
home  
just  
near  
the  
hospital  
we  
want  
it  
to  
be  
comfortable  
we  
don't  
want  
the  
noises  
and  
the  
beeps  
and  
the  
the  
clean  
living  
we  
want  
it  
to  
feel  
good  
and  
like  
a  
home  
like  
we  
want  
just  
just  
feel  
comfortable  
going  
somewhere  
and  
feeling  
safe  
knowing  
that  
our  
our  
kid  
is  
still  
surrounded  
with  
love  
and  
with  
community  
and  
with  
people  
that  
care  
about  
her  
and  
us  
and  
I  
think  
I  
think  
the  
biggest  
thing  
is  
that  
it  
just  
feels  
like  
it's  
a  
home  
and  
not  
spittle  
or  
hospice  
it  
feels  
like  
family  
what  
do  
you  
think  
is  
your  
biggest  
takeaway  
why  
should  
I  
think  
this  
entire  
generation  
should  
be  
looking  
forward  
to  
caring  
for  
our  
next  
generation  
are  
they're  
the  
ones  
that  
are  
going  
to  
be  
looking  
after  
me  
when  
I  
get  
old  
they  
are  
the  
ones  
that  
need  
to  
be  
protected  
and  
loved  
and  
fought  
for  
and  
that's  
our  
job  
as  
adults  
that's  
our  
job  
as  
parents  
as  
doctors  
as  
nurses  
any  
adult  
should  
have  
that  
sense  
of  
taking  
care  
of  
those  
younger  
than  
them  
taking  
care  
of  
kids  
and  
taking  
care  
of  
kids  
that  
have  
cancer  
that  
have  
other  
life  
limiting  
illnesses  
it's  
not  
it's  
not  
fair  
for  
people  
to  
think  
about  
themselves  
and  
you  
know  
it's  
unfortunate  
and  
fortunate  
that  
we  
were  
put  
in  
this  
situation  
because  
I  
was  
thinking  
about  
only  
my  
kids  
and  
my  
family  
and  
now  
I  
have  
the  
opportunity  
to  
think  
about  
all  
these  
kids  
and  
all  
these  
families  
and  
and  
it  
sucks  
that  
it  
took  
cancer  
to  
make  
me  
see  
what  
is  
really  
important  
but  
fortunately  
I  
I  
am  
able  
to  
see  
what's  
really  
important  
and  
I  
can  
see  
that  
there's  
a  
need  
for  
a  
home  
that  
is  
kind  
of  
like  
a  
hospital  
but  
like  
a  
home  
most  
important  
where  
my  
family  
can  
come  
in  
there's  
room  
for  
my  
son  
to  
sleep  
with  
me  
and  
the  
for  
my  
husband  
to  
be  
there  
and  
there's  
room  
for  
my  
family  
that  
come  
there  
wasn't  
that  
at  
the  
hospital  
it  
was  
my  
son  
couldn't  
sleep  
over  
and  
I  
could  
go  
weeks  
without  
holding  
him  
at  
night  
in  
his  
own  
bed  
and  
it  
it  
was  
really  
hard  
me  
but  
it  
was  
more  
hard  
on  
him  
I  
think  
because  
our  
family  
was  
torn  
apart  
for  
a  
year  
and  
a  
half  
and  
it  
changed  
his  
personality  
not  
having  
us  
together  
and  
we  
need  
something  
like  
this  
we  
need  
a  
home  
we  
need  
a  
home  
where  
we  
can  
still  
take  
care  
of  
our  
kid  
that  
has  
cancer  
and  
still  
be  
able  
to  
have  
my  
other  
kid  
feel  
like  
we're  
a  
family  
and  
I  
think  
that's  
the  
what  
really  
what  
I  
really  
want  
ladybug  
house  
to  
be  
is  
I  
want  
I  
want  
families  
to  
stay  
together  
when  
their  
kid  
gets  
a  
diagnosis  
like  
this  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
we  
go  
grab  
them  
oh  
thank  
you  
okay  
so  
also  
she's  
speaking  
IQ

it  
possible  
right  
here

okay  
go  
grab  
a  
chair  
legs  
yeah  
okay  
where  
I'll  
carry  
my  
son  
so  
my  
son  
would  
come  
to  
you  
they  
would  
bring  
his  
dinner  
every  
time  
we  
slept  
over  
at  
the  
hospital  
my  
husband  
started  
to  
work  
so  
it  
wasn't  
you  
know  
he  
got  
the  
weekend  
shift  
but  
we  
got  
every  
other  
day  
we  
slept  
there  
120  
days  
out  
of  
the  
year  
and  
a  
half  
so  
four  
months  
worth  
what  
it's  
a  
cancer  
baby  
okay  
cuz  
that  
house

pretty

oh

okay

me  
to  
put  
the  
blanket  
on  
Earth  
okay
I  
didn't  
really  
know  
what  
was  
wrong  
because  
she  
was  
born  
she  
was  
born  
in  
Houston  
Texas  
and  
in  
a  
what  
is  
it  
called  
like  
when  
you  
have  
a  
midwife  
a  
birth  
center  
so  
she  
was  
born  
out  
of  
the  
birth  
center  
and  
I  
guess  
the  
midwife  
didn't  
really  
notice  
if  
anything  
was  
wrong  
or  
not  
but  
we  
were  
sent  
home  
four  
hours  
after  
she  
was  
born  
and  
there  
was  
a  
little  
bit  
of  
complication  
because  
she  
wasn't  
breathing  
and  
she  
throw  
up  
some  
meconium  
so  
like  
she  
swallowed  
some  
Meccano  
meconium  
is  
so  
if  
meconium  
is  
a  
baby  
poop  
so  
she  
actually  
swallowed  
it  
as  
she  
was  
at  
some  
point  
as  
she  
was  
coming  
out  
and  
so  
she  
threw  
it  
up  
and  
that's  
why  
she  
was  
having  
trouble  
breathing  
it  
took  
me  
I  
think  
I  
think  
in  
the  
matter  
of  
three  
weeks  
she  
saw  
at  
least  
for  
pediatricians  
because  
I  
knew  
I  
could  
tell  
something  
was  
wrong  
and  
every  
time  
I  
would  
mention  
it  
family  
and  
friends  
they  
kept  
saying  
trying  
to  
give  
me  
advice  
I  
guess  
like  
oh  
you're  
you  
know  
I  
had  
a  
bunch  
of  
people  
basically  
just  
telling  
me  
what  
I  
was  
doing  
wrong  
and  
it  
was  
very  
stressful  
and  
then  
I  
had  
a  
lot  
of  
people  
that  
couldn't  
really  
help  
either  
you  
know  
cuz  
family  
works  
and  
you  
know  
things  
like  
that  
so  
I  
was  
me  
and  
her  
eventually  
it  
got  
to  
the  
point  
where  
the  
fourth  
pediatrician  
finally  
did  
say  
you  
know  
what  
she  
has  
a  
a  
heart  
murmur  
he  
got  
us  
in  
with  
with  
a  
cardiologist  
the  
next  
day  
actually  
and  
that's  
when  
she  
started  
getting  
on  
all  
these  
medications  
and  
at  
first  
I  
was  
being  
kind  
of  
stubborn  
because  
the  
way  
I  
grew  
up  
in  
a  
small  
town  
in  
Texas  
and  
where  
I  
don't  
wanna  
say  
hippie-ish  
but  
like  
there's  
a  
lot  
of  
farms  
and  
stuff  
out  
there  
it's  
very  
rural  
and  
we  
our  
parents  
are  
kind  
of  
the  
generation  
where  
they  
didn't  
believe  
in  
taking  
drugs  
of  
any  
kind  
everything  
was  
holistic  
you  
know  
I  
remember  
for  
a  
long  
time  
my  
dad  
said  
my  
asthma  
was  
like  
all  
in  
my  
head  
you  
know  
so  
I  
was  
kinda  
in  
the  
same  
area  
where  
sometimes  
I  
would  
give  
her  
her  
medicine  
sometimes  
I  
didn't  
because  
I  
felt  
like  
I  
was  
drugging  
my  
child  
you  
know  
but  
they  
kind  
of  
kind  
of  
hit  
me  
really  
hard  
because  
she  
didn't  
gain  
any  
weight  
for  
like  
three  
months  
she  
was  
ten  
pounds  
and  
cardiology  
finally  
had  
her  
admitted  
I  
think  
she  
was  
around  
three  
or  
four  
months  
old  
but  
they  
did  
have  
her  
admitted  
and  
I  
kind  
of  
just  
lived  
lived  
at  
the  
Blissey  
I  
lived  
at  
the  
hospital  
for  
like  
seven  
weeks  
and  
of  
course  
I  
could  
have  
just  
left  
her  
there  
but  
I  
didn't  
want  
to  
I  
don't  
know  
if  
she's  
my  
first  
or  
at  
the  
same  
time  
like  
I  
knew  
her  
better  
than  
anybody  
so  
I  
was  
kind  
of  
scared  
to  
leave  
her  
because  
I  
didn't  
know  
if  
even  
if  
it  
was  
a  
hospital  
I  
always  
felt  
like  
like  
I  
couldn't  
trust  
people  
in  
general  
because  
from  
the  
beginning  
we  
were  
alone  
so  
I  
just  
wanted  
to  
be  
there  
just  
in  
case  
but  
I  
think  
it  
was  
around  
four  
times  
that  
they  
actually  
prepped  
her  
for  
her  
heart  
surgery  
for  
it  
is  
to  
fix  
the  
PDA  
as  
a  
PDA  
ligation  
that  
we're  
gonna  
do  
and  
it  
was  
frustrating  
because  
when  
when  
you  
prep  
the  
child  
they  
do  
NPO  
which  
means  
they're  
not  
allowed  
to  
eat  
kid  
not  
even  
water  
so  
they  
stick  
him  
with  
the  
IV  
and  
it  
was  
really  
hard  
for  
them  
to  
find  
her  
vein  
every  
time  
so  
she  
had  
like  
holes  
everywhere  
everywhere  
where  
they  
would  
poke  
her  
so  
she  
of  
course  
I  
have  
to  
see  
her  
screaming  
and  
she's  
hungry  
and  
I  
want  
to  
feed  
her  
and  
I  
don't  
know  
it  
was  
I  
don't  
know  
how  
the  
system  
works  
in  
every  
state  
but  
in  
Texas  
Children's  
the  
way  
it  
worked  
is  
they  
they  
they  
would  
have  
meetings  
every  
morning  
where  
the  
surgeons  
of  
doctors  
would  
basically  
pick  
and  
choose  
what  
kids  
go  
first  
or  
who  
needs  
it  
the  
most  
and  
she  
would  
always  
be  
somewhere  
near  
the  
top  
but  
not  
really  
in  
the  
top  
so  
so  
they'll  
pick  
a  
few  
kids  
they'll  
pick  
a  
few  
kids  
and  
they'll  
put  
them  
at  
the  
top  
and  
okay  
go  
ahead  
and  
prep  
this  
person  
this  
person  
was  
Drew  
this  
person  
so  
she  
was  
prepped  
every  
time  
but  
then  
she  
was  
never  
chosen  
and  
and  
I  
would  
get  
so  
frustrated  
because  
when  
the  
surgery  
should  
be  
around  
6:00  
in  
the  
morning  
they  
would  
wait  
until  
11:00  
sometimes  
12  
in  
the  
afternoon  
to  
send  
somebody  
to  
tell  
me  
oh  
by  
the  
way  
we're  
not  
she's  
not  
going  
to  
surgery  
today  
and  
and  
it's  
irritating  
as  
a  
parent  
because  
you  
know  
because  
they  
wait  
so  
long  
to  
tell  
you  
that's  
it's  
the  
same  
amount  
of  
time  
that  
they're  
not  
eating  
so  
they're  
like  
oh  
oh  
okay  
go  
ahead  
and  
feed  
her  
now  
it's  
like  
oh  
great  
you  
know  
so  
the  
media  
almost  
got  
involved  
because  
one  
of  
her  
one  
of  
her  
hands  
got  
really  
first  
started  
she's  
like  
why  
do  
they  
keep  
doing  
this  
yeah  
you  
know  
and  
I  
told  
one  
of  
the  
nurses  
I  
was  
like  
look  
the  
media  
wants  
to  
get  
involved  
they  
want  
to  
hear  
my  
story  
and  
so  
and  
I  
told  
them  
you  
know  
if  
she  
doesn't  
get  
in  
soon  
you  
keep  
prepping  
her  
you  
keep  
poking  
her  
and  
doing  
all  
this  
stuff  
starving  
her  
basically  
and  
then  
of  
course  
the  
nurse  
talked  
to  
the  
doctors  
and  
everybody  
talked  
to  
everybody  
social  
service  
has  
kind  
of  
evolved  
I  
think  
that  
uh  
were  
they  
called  
a  
patient  
advocate  
I  
think  
that's  
what  
it's  
called  
like  
everybody  
got  
involved  
because  
I  
was  
just  
so  
frustrated  
but  
I  
ended  
up  
not  
talking  
to  
the  
media  
I  
was  
actually  
bluffing  
I  
wasn't  
what  
brother  
wasn't  
ever  
going  
to  
but  
she  
did  
get  
her  
surgery  
and  
it  
was  
it  
was  
kind  
of  
weird  
cuz  
because  
every  
time  
I  
would  
think  
she  
would  
go  
into  
surgery  
and  
when  
she  
doesn't  
I  
would  
I  
would  
say  
man  
I  
can't  
wait  
till  
she  
gets  
her  
surgery  
and  
those  
uh  
and  
when  
the  
day  
finally  
came  
I  
was  
like  
a  
part  
of  
me  
was  
like  
well  
maybe  
I  
don't  
want  
her  
to  
go  
to  
surgery  
because  
they  
had  
the  
whole  
team  
come  
in  
and  
basically  
explain  
what's  
gonna  
happen  
what  
they're  
gonna  
do  
and  
you  
kind  
of  
sit  
there  
and  
take  
it  
like  
okay  
yeah  
alright  
and  
just  
listen  
and  
listen  
to  
listen  
and  
then  
finally  
the  
next  
day  
the  
actual  
surgeon  
comes  
in  
with  
like  
the  
anesthesia  
team  
and  
they  
slap  
like  
like  
a  
bunch  
of  
paper  
in  
front  
of  
you  
which  
is  
basically  
a  
bunch  
of  
waiver  
saying  
if  
she  
dies  
it's  
not  
her  
fault  
so  
it's  
like  
do  
you  
sign  
it  
do  
you  
not  
sign  
it  
like  
is  
this  
a  
last  
time  
gonna  
see  
her  
so  
of  
course  
I  
had  
to  
sign  
it  
and  
and  
that  
her  
surgeon  
was  
super  
nice  
and  
he's  
like  
don't  
worry  
I  
do  
this  
all  
the  
time  
and  
he  
actually  
spoke  
to  
me  
one-on-one  
cuz  
he  
he  
noticed  
I  
was  
you  
know  
getting  
really  
kind  
of  
anxious  
about  
it  
so  
he  
he  
took  
the  
time  
to  
actually  
sit  
down  
with  
me  
he  
took  
the  
time  
to  
sit  
down  
with  
me  
before  
the  
day  
of  
surgery  
in  
the  
morning  
and  
he  
you  
know  
he  
was  
very  
sentimental  
and  
he  
said  
I  
know  
you  
know  
you  
you're  
a  
lot  
of  
parents  
are  
gonna  
be  
worried  
about  
signing  
the  
waivers  
and  
stuff  
like  
that  
kind  
of  
because  
I  
mean  
the  
the  
paper  
is  
pretty  
clear  
if  
something  
happens  
it's  
not  
their  
fault  
you're  
not  
allowed  
to  
sue  
him  
or  
anything  
you  
can't  
you  
can't  
really  
like  
fight  
so  
he  
said  
and  
like  
like  
don't  
worry  
about  
all  
that  
I  
know  
he's  
like  
I  
know  
what  
I'm  
doing  
I  
do  
this  
whole  
time  
you  
know  
it's  
a  
very  
simple  
procedure  
bla  
bla  
bla  
and  
I'm  
like  
okay  
and  
and  
then  
last  
thing  
I  
told  
him  
I  
was  
like  
you  
know  
what  
just  
just  
just  
take  
care  
of  
her  
and  
he's  
like  
and  
he  
said  
it's  
it's  
not  
that  
um  
you  
know  
he's  
like  
a  
lot  
of  
doctors  
say  
I'm  
gonna  
do  
what  
I  
can  
and  
he  
said  
he's  
like  
just  
know  
that  
that  
the  
things  
that  
I  
do  
that  
I  
can  
do  
I  
do  
him  
very  
well  
so  
that  
was  
her  
first  
surgery  
and  
the  
second  
one  
was  
pretty  
simple  
she  
just  
had  
like  
extra  
fingers  
and  
toes  
and  
tongue  
tie  
they  
had  
to  
get  
rid  
of  
and  
when  
I  
moved  
to  
Boston  
with  
my  
husband  
right  
now  
she  
was  
throwing  
up  
almost  
every  
feed  
like  
she  
couldn't  
take  
a  
bottle  
she  
was  
losing  
a  
lot  
of  
weight  
and  
we  
found  
out  
her  
cardiac  
stuff  
was  
coming  
back  
it  
was  
a  
chaotic  
stenosis  
and  
she  
was  
a  
losing  
weight  
again  
she  
was  
very  
sick  
so  
she  
was  
admitted  
again  
and  
this  
time  
it  
was  
to  
get  
a  
g-tube  
and  
it's  
a  
it's  
a  
gastric  
tube  
that's  
attached  
to  
the  
belly  
so  
although  
she  
can  
I  
have  
her  
pictures  
in  
there  
I  
didn't  
really  
know  
that  
much  
until  
I  
called  
Suzanne  
and  
she  
tried  
to  
explain  
the  
best  
she  
could  
you  
know  
it's  
a  
place  
where  
parents  
can  
get  
respite  
care  
and  
so  
they  
can  
have  
time  
to  
basically  
take  
a  
break  
cuz  
you  
know  
a  
lot  
of  
us  
get  
tired  
although  
we're  
fine  
now  
she's  
happy  
and  
stable  
it  
there  
there  
wasn't  
really  
I've  
never  
even  
really  
heard  
of  
anything  
like  
it  
so  
it's  
very  
unique  
in  
itself  
because  
we're  
in  
Texas  
we're  
in  
Massachusetts  
we're  
in  
Connecticut  
and  
and  
it  
was  
it  
was  
very  
difficult  
just  
to  
even  
get  
services  
for  
anything  
and  
really  
as  
far  
as  
a  
respite  
care  
in  
Connecticut  
they  
they  
it  
was  
denied  
because  
they  
said  
that  
it  
was  
didn't  
yeah  
I  
know  
how  
sons  
in  
my  
face  
oh  
I  
want  
to  
break  
this  
thing  
the  
Mike  
thing  
I  
don't  
want  
to  
break  
it  
yeah  
we're  
trying  
to  
basically  
focus  
on  
okay  
you  
are  
experienced  
in  
the  
hospital  
and  
kind  
of  
the  
community  
support  
what  
was  
it  
like  
did  
you  
have  
do  
I  
put  
it  
behind  
me  
and  
support  
each  
other  
it  
seems  
like  
that's  
yeah  
I  
think  
though  
I  
think  
the  
hardest  
thing  
in  
the  
beginning  
is  
not  
really  
knowing  
who  
to  
ask  
because  
you  
you  
could  
be  
at  
home  
and  
doing  
all  
this  
stuff  
and  
going  
to  
the  
hospital  
but  
until  
you  
really  
ask  
and  
you  
have  
to  
ask  
the  
right  
questions  
cuz  
a  
lot  
of  
the  
time  
the  
hospitals  
like  
kind  
of  
handing  
you  
a  
bunch  
of  
pamphlets  
oh  
do  
this  
and  
that  
this  
and  
that  
but  
at  
the  
same  
time  
you  
you  
kind  
of  
look  
at  
the  
stuff  
and  
you're  
like  
well  
when  
am  
I  
going  
to  
find  
time  
to  
do  
any  
of  
this  
and  
and  
of  
course  
people  
house  
people  
are  
scared  
to  
watch  
your  
kid  
because  
they're  
like  
oh  
what  
if  
this  
happens  
and  
this  
happens  
when  
I'm  
there  
I  
don't  
know  
what  
to  
do  
and  
and  
I  
don't  
know  
so  
essentially  
the  
way  
I  
even  
learned  
about  
anything  
is  
through  
most  
of  
it  
was  
it  
wasn't  
when  
we  
were  
in  
Boston  
they  
had  
there  
was  
a  
school  
for  
the  
blind  
it's  
called  
Perkins  
school  
for  
the  
blind  
in  
Boston  
and  
they  
actually  
had  
a  
parent  
group  
where  
the  
main  
thing  
that  
our  
kids  
had  
in  
common  
was  
the  
vision  
but  
medically  
they  
were  
all  
completely  
different  
and  
and  
I  
wasn't  
the  
only  
one  
who  
felt  
like  
this  
it  
was  
several  
of  
us  
it's  
kind  
of  
a  
relief  
to  
see  
that  
you're  
not  
the  
only  
one  
struggling  
you're  
not  
the  
only  
one  
not  
knowing  
what  
to  
do  
or  
who  
to  
who  
to  
go  
to  
and  
there's  
some  
parents  
that  
it's  
not  
that  
they're  
afraid  
to  
ask  
it's  
more  
like  
like  
a  
pride  
thing  
like  
why  
should  
I  
ask  
you  
know  
I  
can  
do  
this  
by  
myself  
you  
know  
I'm  
the  
parent  
and  
when  
it  
gets  
to  
a  
point  
where  
you  
kind  
of  
have  
to  
ask  
you  
gotta  
swallow  
your  
pride  
and  
realize  
this  
isn't  
about  
you  
this  
is  
about  
the  
child  
she  
has  
to  
grow  
up  
she  
has  
to  
meet  
kids  
like  
her  
she  
has  
to  
socialize  
because  
because  
who  
knows  
I  
could  
have  
been  
a  
parent  
that  
was  
completely  
antisocial  
and  
because  
of  
me  
maybe  
she  
would  
have  
strived  
which  
sometimes  
is  
the  
case  
but  
it  
was  
it  
was  
the  
other  
parents  
that  
kind  
of  
built  
up  
my  
confidence  
because  
they  
said  
you  
know  
what  
this  
is  
what  
I  
did  
this  
might  
work  
for  
you  
this  
is  
this  
is  
the  
easy  
way  
this  
is  
the  
easy  
path  
to  
get  
to  
whatever  
you  
need  
to  
do  
in  
some  
specifics  
something  
that  
you  
reached  
out  
to  
other  
parents  
and  
they  
helped  
you  
out  
whether  
it's  
through  
giving  
you  
peace  
of  
mind  
or  
just  
getting  
some  
sort  
of  
support  
yes  
so  
actually  
before  
I  
even  
joined  
any  
Facebook  
groups  
because  
because  
sometimes  
I  
felt  
like  
because  
it  
could  
go  
it  
could  
go  
kind  
of  
both  
ways  
you  
don't  
want  
to  
ask  
for  
help  
because  
you  
feel  
like  
you  
don't  
need  
it  
but  
at  
the  
same  
time  
when  
when  
when  
I  
was  
at  
in  
the  
in  
the  
parent  
group  
for  
Perkins  
these  
kids  
were  
way  
sicker  
than  
my  
daughter  
so  
I  
kind  
of  
felt  
guilty  
there  
was  
a  
lot  
of  
there  
there  
was  
a  
lot  
of  
Gil  
but  
and  
I  
did  
express  
that  
in  
the  
group  
and  
the  
parents  
were  
like  
you  
know  
what  
we  
don't  
even  
think  
about  
that  
like  
sometimes  
I'm  
so  
I'm  
so  
like  
you  
pie  
thinking  
of  
what  
other  
people  
are  
thinking  
like  
oh  
my  
god  
they're  
just  
like  
all  
eyes  
on  
me  
but  
but  
that's  
not  
even  
the  
case  
like  
maybe  
another  
parents  
thinking  
the  
same  
thing  
I'm  
thinking  
but  
I'm  
not  
really  
paying  
attention  
like  
we're  
so  
occupied  
in  
our  
kind  
of  
our  
own  
thing  
that  
that's  
something  
that  
kind  
of  
gave  
me  
a  
peace  
of  
mind  
that  
that  
they  
did  
say  
you  
know  
I  
we're  
not  
in  
competition  
of  
whose  
kid  
is  
sicker  
we're  
not  
in  
competition  
of  
who's  
getting  
better  
faster  
it's  
it's  
literally  
it  
was  
literally  
about  
the  
kids  
and  
that  
was  
that  
wasn't  
another  
like  
realization  
because  
she's  
my  
first  
I'm  
not  
really  
that  
oh  
I  
mean  
I'm  
26  
but  
you  
know  
I  
still  
feel  
like  
a  
kid  
myself  
so  
I  
don't  
really  
know  
what  
I'm  
supposed  
to  
be  
doing  
and  
it's  
it's  
it's  
who  
we're  
like  
one  
I  
didn't  
know  
what  
I  
was  
doing  
in  
general  
because  
she's  
my  
first  
kid  
and  
two  
I  
didn't  
really  
know  
what  
I  
was  
doing  
because  
she's  
special  
needs  
so  
now  
it's  
like  
kind  
of  
like  
a  
double  
whammy  
and  
I  
had  
to  
learn  
to  
be  
her  
nurse  
at  
the  
same  
time  
so  
I  
was  
like  
I  
was  
a  
mom  
I  
was  
a  
nurse  
I  
was  
her  
caretaker  
I  
was  
everything  
and  
and  
and  
the  
other  
parents  
helped  
me  
realize  
that  
it's  
it's  
okay  
to  
ask  
for  
help  
like  
respite  
care  
and  
asking  
for  
a  
nurse  
because  
I  
first  
I  
I  
didn't  
feel  
okay  
asking  
for  
for  
nursing  
hours  
but  
but  
they  
said  
you  
know  
you  
need  
to  
sleep  
at  
some  
point  
right  
because  
I  
felt  
like  
I  
was  
losing  
my  
mind  
and  
there  
was  
actually  
I  
met  
I  
met  
this  
mom  
that  
she  
was  
an  
advocate  
in  
Boston  
and  
she  
she  
she  
was  
the  
main  
one  
who  
gave  
everybody  
resources  
she  
would  
give  
out  
pamphlets  
and  
she  
was  
always  
excited  
about  
everything  
and  
even  
though  
sometimes  
her  
child  
was  
in  
the  
hospital  
and  
she  
would  
always  
make  
sure  
to  
call  
and  
message  
and  
say  
hey  
you  
know  
everything's  
good  
I  
hope  
y'all  
are  
good  
a  
whole  
group  
is  
doing  
good  
and  
I'm  
like  
she's  
going  
away  
from  
way  
worse  
than  
I'm  
that  
I'm  
going  
through  
you  
know  
so  
I  
think  
I'll  
survive  
like  
I  
get  
that  
you  
know  
you're  
fine  
and  
if  
if  
my  
daughter's  
happy  
then  
I  
should  
be  
happy  
I  
shouldn't  
look  
at  
other  
kids  
and  
compare  
her  
because  
she's  
her  
you  
know  
she's  
never  
gonna  
be  
another  
kid  
and  
that's  
with  
any  
kid  
you  
know  
they're  
they're  
all  
so  
unique  
and  
and  
you  
have  
to  
get  
to  
know  
them  
and  
sometimes  
you  
feel  
like  
they  
don't  
do  
anything  
but  
then  
they  
smile  
at  
you  
and  
and  
when  
they're  
in  
group  
together  
there  
you  
get  
all  
the  
kids  
together  
and  
you  
think  
that  
they're  
not  
interacting  
but  
they  
do  
pay  
attention  
to  
each  
other  
they  
smile  
they  
laugh  
they  
make  
noises  
kind  
of  
like  
like  
normal  
kids  
I  
guess  
like  
like  
the  
way  
I  
like  
to  
picture  
it  
is  
that  
even  
though  
out  
here  
we  
like  
to  
kind  
of  
see  
them  
like  
they're  
not  
normal  
but  
like  
appear  
like  
they're  
kind  
of  
stuck  
in  
there  
in  
their  
own  
little  
world  
or  
in  
their  
head  
so  
they're  
in  
there  
somewhere  
we  
just  
got  
a  
but  
that's  
what  
doing  
the  
grooves  
doing  
PT  
doing  
ot  
you  
know  
it's  
occupational  
therapy  
so  
that's  
like  
it's  
similar  
to  
developmental  
therapy  
but  
it's  
more  
I  
think  
it's  
just  
it's  
more  
like  
sensory  
development  
because  
he  
be  
turning  
you  
know  
hander  
toy  
she's  
not  
gonna  
want  
to  
grab  
it  
it's  
like  
you  
have  
to  
teach  
them  
that  
they  
can  
they  
can  
stick  
their  
hand  
down  
and  
grab  
something  
versus  
just  
knowing  
it's  
not  
something  
that  
they  
just  
know  
anything  
else  
I  
guess  
it's  
okay  
do  
you  
know  
a  
ladybug  
house  
and  
palliative  
care  
you  
kind  
of  
understand  
all  
of  
that  
right  
what  
they're  
trying  
to  
create  
I  
think  
they're  
trying  
to  
create  
a  
place  
where  
we're  
because  
there  
are  
some  
people  
that  
really  
can't  
get  
the  
help  
that  
they  
need  
to  
get  
and  
this  
is  
a  
place  
where  
they  
can  
feel  
safe  
and  
know  
that  
it's  
not  
just  
some  
babysitter  
it's  
actually  
somebody  
who  
knows  
what  
they're  
doing  
and  
you  
can  
feel  
comfortable  
and  
not  
be  
freaked  
out  
and  
call  
every  
10  
seconds  
or  
send  
me  
a  
picture  
you  
know  
you  
can  
relax  
and  
kind  
of  
have  
a  
guilt-free  
day  
you  
know  
they  
can  
basically  
spend  
their  
last  
months  
or  
like  
the  
last  
days  
and  
in  
that  
in  
ladybug  
house  
and  
not  
in  
a  
hospital  
I  
think  
that  
was  
one  
of  
the  
bigger  
yeah  
that's  
of  
it  
too  
I  
didn't  
know  
that  
part  
[Music]  
[Music]  
we  
need  
for  
each  
other  
who  
says  
a  
tape  
that  
again  
gets  
procedure  
yeah  
that's  
all  
guy  
they  
were  
trying  
to  
change  
that  
[Music]  
versus  
having  
to  
go  
through  
all  
that  
Pro  
all  
that  
stuff  
yeah  
she  
said  
that  
in  
the  
last  
days  
I  
take  
a  
24/7  
job  
right  
so  
you're  
basically  
having  
to  
play  
the  
role  
of  
nurse  
and  
mother  
which  
isn't  
like  
the  
best  
way  
to  
remember  
the  
child  
but  
also  
her  
siblings  
of  
the  
rest  
of  
the  
family  
because  
their  
interaction  
to  
complete  
different  
what  
they  
have  
to  
pay  
yeah  
[Music]  
if  
you  
could  
just  
me  
perhaps  
talk  
about  
what  
ladybug  
house  
could  
have  
done  
for  
you  
if  
that  
was  
existed  
so  
well  
with  
the  
first  
surgery  
when  
I  
was  
living  
in  
the  
hospital  
with  
her  
I  
actually  
did  
get  
to  
the  
point  
where  
I  
had  
a  
breakdown  
and  
I  
was  
like  
you  
know  
what  
she's  
gonna  
die  
you  
know  
and  
I  
was  
like  
I  
didn't  
except  
at  
an  
acceptance  
and  
I  
went  
through  
a  
period  
I  
think  
of  
I  
think  
it  
only  
lasted  
like  
a  
week  
because  
the  
nurses  
noticed  
that  
I  
was  
kind  
of  
shut  
down  
yeah  
I  
was  
basically  
living  
but  
I  
was  
like  
sleeping  
on  
the  
couch  
in  
her  
room  
so  
I  
could  
have  
left  
left  
like  
the  
other  
parents  
of  
course  
but  
I  
chose  
not  
to  
I  
wanted  
to  
be  
by  
her  
side  
I  
chose  
to  
live  
there  
I  
stayed  
they  
didn't  
have  
a  
bed  
for  
me  
so  
I  
stayed  
on  
I  
sit  
on  
a  
couch  
in  
her  
bedroom  
right  
next  
to  
her  
her  
crib  
and  
because  
I  
didn't  
I  
wasn't  
really  
getting  
any  
help  
with  
with  
as  
far  
as  
her  
biological  
father  
family  
you  
know  
they  
had  
kind  
of  
their  
own  
thing  
going  
on  
I  
was  
day  
and  
night  
well  
that's  
Josh  
the  
chef  
in  
the  
beginning  
you  
want  
your  
water  
okay  
my  
phone  
or  
take  
my  
phone  
just  
take  
it  
I'm  
gonna  
chunk  
it  
over  
here  
sorry  
okay  
don't  
wait  
for  
them  
we're  
okay  
so  
I  
was  
living  
in  
the  
hospital  
with  
my  
daughter  
and  
I  
was  
sleeping  
on  
the  
couch  
and  
even  
though  
we  
were  
in  
a  
hospital  
where  
there  
was  
nurses  
and  
doctors  
there  
were  
still  
times  
where  
I  
would  
jolt  
awake  
because  
I  
could  
hear  
choking  
or  
aspirating  
or  
throwing  
up  
or  
something  
was  
wrong  
and  
of  
course  
this  
was  
Texas  
Children's  
and  
the  
the  
cardiac  
unit  
was  
always  
full  
it  
was  
always  
full  
so  
you  
have  
nurses  
kind  
of  
running  
back  
and  
forth  
and  
sometimes  
they  
don't  
hear  
something  
and  
I  
just  
I  
I  
just  
felt  
more  
comfortable  
being  
there  
because  
you  
know  
like  
what  
if  
something  
happened  
and  
she  
had  
passed  
out  
like  
like  
the  
guilt  
from  
not  
just  
not  
being  
there  
would  
have  
would  
have  
just  
messed  
me  
up  
completely  
so  
even  
though  
even  
those  
at  
the  
hospital  
I  
still  
wasn't  
getting  
the  
sleep  
that  
I  
needed  
and  
eventually  
[Music]  
let's  
go  
from  
even  
though  
I  
was  
in  
Oslo  
Urich  
last  
phrase  
okay  
even  
those  
in  
the  
hospital  
I  
didn't  
really  
get  
that  
much  
sleep  
because  
every  
single  
noise  
was  
kind  
of  
scary  
because  
when  
we  
were  
at  
home  
those  
noises  
were  
life-threatening  
so  
the  
cardiac  
unit  
was  
always  
since  
and  
and  
I  
was  
actually  
I  
I  
didn't  
even  
notice  
when  
I  
wasn't  
eating  
but  
a  
nurse  
noticed  
I  
wasn't  
eating  
and  
she  
said  
you  
know  
do  
you  
have  
any  
food  
do  
you  
have  
any  
money  
and  
I  
didn't  
even  
know  
as  
a  
problem  
at  
the  
time  
because  
I  
was  
more  
worried  
about  
my  
daughter  
I  
was  
like  
no  
I'm  
fine  
I'm  
fine  
I'm  
fine  
and  
and  
her  
biological  
father  
like  
I  
said  
he  
wasn't  
really  
there  
he  
didn't  
give  
me  
any  
money  
for  
food  
you  
know  
he  
didn't  
go  
up  
there  
just  
to  
see  
her  
so  
I  
had  
to  
swallow  
my  
pride  
and  
I  
asked  
for  
help  
but  
in  
the  
beginning  
I  
almost  
gave  
up  
because  
they  
said  
oh  
well  
your  
your  
or  
her  
dad  
makes  
enough  
money  
why  
do  
you  
need  
help  
so  
then  
that's  
when  
I  
got  
the  
social  
services  
involved  
and  
they  
the  
best  
they  
could  
do  
at  
the  
time  
they  
gave  
me  
these  
these  
voucher  
cards  
where  
I  
could  
get  
a  
meal  
a  
day  
in  
the  
cafeteria  
and  
that  
that  
didn't  
really  
do  
much  
honestly  
but  
at  
least  
I  
survived  
a  
little  
bit  
and  
and  
some  
people  
were  
some  
of  
my  
friends  
would  
say  
well  
don't  
you  
have  
family  
to  
help  
you  
can't  
you  
take  
turns  
with  
somebody  
watching  
her  
in  
the  
hospital  
and  
said  
no  
you  
know  
oldest  
is  
dressed  
for  
kids  
you  
know  
I  
guess  
there's  
one  
on  
the  
way  
my  
brother  
lives  
in  
a  
whole  
different  
City  
you  
know  
my  
mom  
is  
she's  
visually  
impaired  
you  
know  
she  
lives  
on  
SSI  
so  
we  
can't  
do  
any  
of  
that  
we  
can't  
I  
couldn't  
ask  
anybody  
for  
help  
and  
when  
I  
got  
more  
comfortable  
there  
I  
did  
start  
to  
get  
more  
sleep  
but  
afterwards  
when  
she  
got  
when  
we  
finally  
went  
home  
after  
all  
the  
shenanigans  
of  
trying  
to  
get  
her  
the  
surgery  
it  
so  
I  
was  
I  
was  
they  
gave  
me  
the  
this  
is  
the  
same  
the  
same  
thing  
as  
before  
like  
okay  
here's  
your  
discharge  
papers  
she  
needs  
this  
medicine  
this  
time  
the  
spend  
this  
time  
and  
you  
do  
this  
and  
that  
and  
you  
you  
read  
all  
this  
stuff  
and  
you  
you're  
kind  
of  
like  
you  
know  
when  
when  
is  
it  
time  
for  
me  
but  
you  
know  
whatever  
you  
know  
you're  
the  
parent  
it's  
your  
job  
that's  
what  
you  
got  
to  
do  
so  
just  
get  
it  
done  
and  
then  
do  
you  
want  
me  
to  
elaborate  
on  
anything  
and  
I'm  
going  
past  
the  
hospital  
thing  
already  
oh  
wait  
I'm  
sorry  
I  
remember  
I  
forgot  
the  
point  
what  
what  
lady  
what  
lady  
book  
house  
could  
have  
could  
have  
helped  
right  
if  
Texas  
had  
something  
like  
that  
like  
ladybug  
house  
which  
is  
something  
something  
very  
rare  
like  
something  
I  
wouldn't  
even  
think  
of  
kind  
of  
like  
something  
you  
would  
think  
only  
people  
with  
money  
would  
do  
like  
send  
your  
family  
members  
somewhere  
nice  
they're  
somewhere  
comfortable  
before  
they  
can  
pass  
without  
all  
the  
stress  
and  
if  
if  
she  
if  
she  
would  
have  
passed  
next  
to  
me  
in  
the  
hospital  
even  
though  
I  
was  
there  
there's  
the  
I  
still  
wouldn't  
have  
felt  
a  
hundred  
percent  
like  
I  
did  
my  
job  
as  
her  
parent  
of  
letting  
her  
pass  
peacefully  
because  
you  
got  
you  
got  
all  
this  
stuff  
on  
you  
you're  
in  
a  
cold  
room  
there's  
all  
this  
noise  
of  
course  
people  
running  
in  
and  
out  
you're  
not  
the  
only  
kid  
in  
there  
so  
of  
course  
you  
got  
everybody  
screaming  
around  
you  
I  
think  
if  
if  
I  
was  
able  
to  
take  
her  
to  
a  
place  
like  
that  
like  
ladybug  
house  
even  
though  
she  
was  
just  
a  
baby  
you  
know  
she  
still  
is  
she's  
still  
a  
person  
I  
think  
visually  
she  
would  
have  
been  
able  
to  
take  
in  
like  
this  
kind  
of  
peaceful  
environment  
versus  
the  
hectic  
anxious  
people  
always  
around  
her  
you  
know  
she  
has  
to  
hear  
me  
and  
the  
group  
of  
doctors  
them  
explaining  
what's  
going  
on  
she  
has  
to  
hear  
me  
ask  
all  
these  
questions  
when  
that  
could  
be  
done  
in  
a  
whole  
different  
place  
or  
at  
least  
you  
know  
with  
a  
different  
attitude  
versus  
you  
know  
the  
doctors  
always  
like  
this  
they  
that  
when  
they  
do  
the  
rounds  
twice  
a  
day  
they  
go  
boom  
boom  
this  
patient  
this  
patient  
that's  
what  
we're  
gonna  
do  
okay  
you  
get  
five  
minutes  
and  
I  
know  
sometimes  
they  
don't  
mean  
to  
but  
you  
know  
they  
kind  
of  
rush  
the  
parents  
like  
come  
on  
Lady  
I  
guess  
let  
me  
answer  
your  
questions  
you  
know  
Oh  
like  
and  
then  
they  
go  
well  
whatever  
you  
need  
to  
test  
the  
nurse  
and  
the  
nurse  
comes  
in  
you  
ask  
him  
they're  
like  
oh  
they  
didn't  
tell  
you  
you  
know  
you're  
just  
like  
you  
know  
I  
forget  
it  
I  
know  
I'm  
running  
off  
again  
I'm  
sorry  
I  
have  
to  
like  
even  
though  
even  
though  
it  
was  
kind  
of  
recent  
like  
two  
two  
years  
ago  
maybe  
two  
and  
a  
half  
years  
ago  
because  
she's  
almost  
three  
it  
it's  
more  
like  
a  
it's  
it's  
more  
like  
a  
like  
a  
flashback  
trauma  
thing  
because  
my  
husband  
wants  
more  
kids  
but  
at  
the  
same  
time  
I  
still  
have  
all  
these  
fresh  
memories  
of  
of  
this  
baby  
that  
was  
struggling  
and  
at  
the  
point  
was  
not  
gonna  
make  
it  
and  
you're  
and  
I  
just  
come  
just  
kind  
of  
like  
no  
I  
can't  
do  
that  
again  
and  
there's  
different  
types  
of  
people  
that  
I  
have  
met  
to  
where  
some  
parents  
that  
I  
met  
at  
the  
hospital  
in  
Texas  
that  
they  
were  
there  
for  
maybe  
seven  
years  
waiting  
for  
a  
heart  
transplant  
and  
I'm  
like  
well  
I've  
only  
been  
here  
like  
four  
weeks  
what  
am  
i  
complaining  
about  
right  
and  
some  
of  
them  
were  
so  
stressed  
out  
kind  
of  
kind  
of  
out  
of  
it  
and  
they're  
like  
I  
don't  
want  
to  
say  
this  
out  
loud  
but  
in  
private  
I  
kind  
of  
do  
wish  
my  
child  
would  
just  
you  
know  
let  
go  
already  
because  
it  
might  
be  
easier  
on  
the  
rest  
of  
us  
but  
it's  
still  
kind  
of  
my  
stuff  
you  
know  
it  
goes  
both  
ways  
but  
she's  
my  
first  
so  
with  
these  
parents  
have  
like  
multiple  
kids  
they're  
they're  
like  
well  
maybe  
this  
one  
could  
just  
pass  
so  
I  
can  
take  
care  
of  
her  
so  
well  
but  
for  
me  
I  
was  
I  
was  
I  
I  
mean  
they  
got  
me  
kind  
of  
double  
thinking  
it  
but  
at  
the  
same  
time  
when  
I  
when  
I  
picture  
actually  
happening  
I'm  
like  
I  
don't  
think  
I  
could  
handle  
it  
so  
I  
had  
to  
stop  
being  
stubborn  
at  
the  
hospital  
and  
start  
actually  
doing  
everything  
that  
the  
doctors  
wanted  
me  
to  
do  
because  
sometimes  
because  
she  
had  
an  
NG  
tube  
and  
that's  
a  
nasal  
gastric  
tube  
to  
feed  
and  
from  
the  
beginning  
they  
would  
say  
you  
know  
we  
really  
need  
to  
get  
her  
a  
g-tube  
so  
she  
can  
gain  
weight  
and  
I  
was  
very  
reluctant  
because  
I  
didn't  
want  
to  
me  
it  
was  
like  
I  
don't  
I  
don't  
want  
a  
hole  
in  
my  
baby's  
stomach  
but  
I  
had  
to  
learn  
from  
her  
other  
parents  
which  
is  
actually  
she  
got  
her  
g-tube  
after  
I  
was  
in  
the  
Perkins  
group  
and  
there  
was  
other  
kids  
with  
G  
tubes  
and  
that  
was  
where  
I  
felt  
more  
comfortable  
they're  
like  
yeah  
the  
surgery  
was  
easy  
my  
child's  
gaining  
weight  
you  
shouldn't  
you  
should  
really  
look  
more  
into  
it  
because  
at  
that  
point  
she  
was  
throwing  
up  
all  
the  
time  
I  
wasn't  
gaining  
anything  
so  
I  
learned  
to  
trust  
the  
doctors  
from  
the  
other  
parents  
and  
their  
experiences  
and  
when  
I  
started  
actually  
listening  
and  
stopped  
being  
scared  
that's  
when  
she  
started  
getting  
better  
and  
even  
though  
I  
felt  
as  
a  
parent  
that  
I  
was  
doing  
the  
right  
thing  
now  
that  
she  
is  
better  
I  
a  
part  
of  
me  
is  
like  
well  
I  
should  
have  
just  
done  
that  
earlier  
you  
know  
I  
should  
have  
just  
done  
this  
and  
this  
and  
this  
earlier  
but  
I  
I  
just  
I  
felt  
like  
I  
was  
I  
was  
protecting  
her  
you  
know  
you  
don't  
want  
your  
kid  
to  
go  
into  
surgery  
multiple  
times  
and  
get  
cut  
and  
you  
know  
she  
she  
was  
at  
one  
point  
she  
was  
addicted  
to  
like  
methadone  
and  
morphine  
just  
from  
after  
surgery  
so  
as  
they  
had  
she  
was  
going  
through  
withdrawal  
so  
I'm  
always  
picturing  
like  
oh  
well  
how  
many  
times  
is  
she  
gonna  
go  
through  
all  
this  
stuff  
before  
she  
gets  
better  
maybe  
we  
should  
just  
leave  
her  
and  
let  
her  
be  
so  
so  
that's  
what  
I  
learned  
from  
the  
the  
parent  
group  
was  
just  
to  
be  
more  
comfortable  
with  
the  
surgeries  
and  
all  
that  
stuff  
because  
it  
was  
so  
new  
and  
fresh  
to  
me  
and  
in  
general  
I  
didn't  
have  
family  
members  
that  
had  
to  
go  
through  
any  
of  
that  
stuff  
she's  
the  
first  
good
